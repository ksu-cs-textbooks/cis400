Code version control is a staple of modern software development.  So it's a good idea to learn and practice it _now_, so it becomes a core element of your software development practice.  This appendix covers one of the most popular distributed version control software in use today - Git.  It also covers one of the most popular online platforms for hosting remote Git repositories - GitHub.  (Hint: Dispite the tendency for many programmers to use the names interchangably, they _aren't_ the same thing!)

Over the next few sections we'll take you through the basic concepts of how Git actually works, and then show you the most common _workflows_ you'll find yourself using with Git.
