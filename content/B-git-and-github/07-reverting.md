As we suggested earlier in the chapter, one of the most important uses of a version control system is to allow you to revert to an earlier version of your code.  To ask Git to list the available commits, you can use the **git log** command:

```
$ git log
```

This should print a list of the commits and thier details:

![git log output]({{<static "images/b.7.1.png">}})
