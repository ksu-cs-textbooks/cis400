This textbook was authored for the **CIS 400 - Object-Oriented Design, Implementation, and Testing** course at Kansas State University.  This section describes assignments specific to the **Fall 2022** offering of that course.  If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.

The projects for this semester are all centered around the creation of software to support a fast-food restaurant chain serving fried pies and ice cream, the **Fried Piper**. We will be developing this program iteratively, and each week we will have a new set of features to add and turn in as a milestone. Each milestone will represent a new release in your git repository.

The milestone due dates are:
