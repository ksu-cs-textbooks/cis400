### Assignment Details

For this milestone you will be adding descriptions to your menu items, modifying your filtering approach to use LINQ, and using CSS media queries to make your website responsive.

Beyond these core requirements, you may add features and elements as you see fit. Moreover, you are encouraged to style the site using CSS.

#### Descriptions

Refactor your `IOrderItem` interface to include a new property, `Description`, and add the provided descriptions to each Entree, Side, and Drink:

##### Entrees

* **Double Draugr:** Double patty burger on a brioche bun. Comes with ketchup, mustard, pickle, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and mayo.
* **Thalmor Tripple:** Think you are strong enough to take on the Thalmor? Inlcudes two 1/4lb patties with a 1/2lb patty inbetween with ketchup, mustard, pickle, cheese, tomato, lettuce, mayo, bacon, and an egg.
* **Smokehouse Skeleton:** Put some meat on those bones with a small stack of pancakes. Includes sausage links, eggs, and hash browns on the side. Topped with the syrup of your choice.
* **Garden Orc Omelette:** Vegetarian. Two egg omelette packed with a mix of broccoli, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Topped with cheddar cheese.

* **Warrior Water:** It's water.  Just water.

#### Display Descriptions to the Website
Add displaying the descriptions to your index page. You are free to format and style these however you like.

#### Responsive Design
Use CSS media queries to make your menu responsive - on screens wider than 490 pixels, you should display the menu as three columns, but on screens smaller than that (i.e. phones), display them as a single column.

#### Search and Filter Functionality
Refactor your searching and filtering function to use LINQ queries.  In addition, expand your search to include the description text.  If multiple search terms are included, i.e. "Potato Ketchup", you should find everything with "Potato" in the name or descrition _and_ everything with "Ketchup" in the name and description.
