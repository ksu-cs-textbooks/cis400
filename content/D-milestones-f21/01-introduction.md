The projects for this semester are all centered around the creation of software to support a fast-food restaurant chain, **Dogs 'N Such**. We will be developing this program iteratively, and each week we will have a new set of features to add and turn in as a milestone. Each milestone will represent a new release in your git repository.

These milestones are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Week</th>
    <th>Milestone</th>
    <th>Due</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td><a href="{{<ref "d-milestones-u21/03-milestone-1">}}">Milestone 1</a></td>
    <td>6/13/2021</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td><a href="{{<ref "d-milestones-u21/04-milestone-2">}}">Milestone 2</a></td>
    <td>6/20/2021</td>
  </tr>
