Jean Piaget was a biologist and psychologist who performed some of the earliest studies on knowledge acquisition in children.  His work is the foundation of [Constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)), one of the more influential philosopies of education.

## Genetic Epistemology
Of especial interest to us is his theory of _genetic epistemology_.  Epistemology is the study of human knowledge, and genetic in this sense refers to _origins_ i.e. the _genesis_, so his theory concerns _how knowledge is created by humans_.

Piaget's genetic epistemology was inspired by studies he conducted of snails of the genus Lymnea native to the lakes of his home, Switzerland.  He was able to establish that what had previously been considered different species of snails based on the shape of thier shells were actually one species.  He showed that when the snails of one lake were placed in a different lake, the way thier shells grew changed to match those of the snails living in the second lake.  In other words, the traits the snails displayed altered in response to thier environment.

Piaget suspected a similar mechanism was at work in human learning.  He proposed that the human brain, much like the bodies of the snails, sought to exist in equilibrium with its environment.  For the brain, this environment meant the ideas it was exposed to.  He proposed two different mechanisms for learning, _accomodation_ and _assimilation_, which related to how structures of knowledge were formed in the brain.  

Assimilation refered to the process of adding new knowledge into exsisting mental structures.  For example, once you know of and understand colors, you might encounter a new one - say periwinkle, which falls between blue and violet.  Since you already know blue and violet, adding the knoweldge of periwinkle is a straightforward task for the brain of assigning it to a slot between the two in the mental structure of 'colors'.  

In contrast, accomodation refers to the process by which knowledge _for which you have no mental structures to represent_ are learned. This process involves _building_ these mental structures, and is far more work.  Modern cognitive science equates this process to the formation and reinforcement of new connections between neurons - a significant biological investement. Thus, triggering accomodation requires significant stimulus, in the form of wrestling with concepts that are currently beyond your grasp - a struggle that creates _disequilibrum_ for your brain, eventually leading to it creating the new structure to accomodate the new knowledge.

This is the basis of the 'eureka' moment, when a difficult concept has finally become clear.  No doubt you have experienced this in a subject such as mathematics or programming, where a skill or idea you've been struggling with suddenly snaps into place, and becomes far easier to work with.  This is also why your math and programming courses put so much emphasis on homework - this work helps create the disequalibrium you need to trigger accomodation.  This is also why mindsets are so powerful - a fixed mindset provides a _different_ mechanism for managing cognitive disequalibrium - by denying your ability to learn a subject, you provide justification for not engaging in the learning process.

## Stage Theory
In addition to the mechanisms of accomodation and assimilation he outlined in his Genetic Epistemology theories, Piaget identified four stages children progress through as they learn to reason more abstractly.  Those stages are:

* **Sensorimotor** - where the learner uses their senses to interact with thier surroundings.  This is the hallmark of babies and toddlers who gaze wide-eyed at, touch, and taste the objects in thier surroundings.
* **Preoperational** - in this stage the learner begins to think _symbolically_, using words and pictures to reprsent objects and actions.
* **Concrete Operational** - In this stage, the learner begins to think logically, but only about concrete events.  Inductive logic - the ability to reason from specific information to a general principle also appears.
* **Formal Operational** - This final stage marks the ability to grasp and work with abstractions, and is marked by hypothetico-deductive reasoning (i.e. formulating and testing hypotheses)

## Neo-Piagetian Theory
While Piaget focused his study on children, many of the researchers who followed him also looked at how _adults_ learn.  Their findings suggest that _all_ learners progress through the four stages with _any_ new learning.  That is, when you begin to learn a novel concept or skill, you are building the cognitive structures necessary to support it, and that your progress through this process corresponds to these four stages.  Moreover, they have found that the divisions between stages are not rigid and clearly delineated; learners can exist in multiple stages at once (which they call the _overlapping waves model_).
