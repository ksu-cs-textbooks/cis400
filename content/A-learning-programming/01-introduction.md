You may not have given much thought to how you are learning to program. Very likely, you've just been engrossed in _doing so_.  But understanding the learning process can help you improve how quickly, and how well you learn.  As we tackle the subject of object-oriented programming, it will greatly benefit you to have a better grasp of exactly what's going on upstairs. Especially as we embark on our first semester-long programming project. In the immortal words of Doc Brown, things are about to get heavy! [^backtothefuture]

[^backtothefuture]: This is a reference to the classic 1985 film "Back to the Future," in which Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) travels back in time to save his scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Loyd). An advance warning: Many of my pop-culture references are going to be grounded in the 80's and 90's.  You may be more familiar with the animated show "Rick and Morty," which was inspired by Doc and Marty's relationship in the film.
