So what does all of this mean in the context of _your_ learning?  

* Developing into an expert programmer is going to take hard work
* It will require a _lot_ of writing and reading code 
* There is _no_ shortcut in this learning process, because _you must create disequilibrium in your brain_ in order for the necessary cognitive structures to form through the process of accommodation
* This process can be very frustrating
* _You can **do this**_, just as many students before you have

What can you do to improve your learning process?
* Get enough sleep, both in quantity and regularity
* Exercise regularly
* Engage with the readings and activities.
* Take notes, annotate your text, draw concept diagrams
* Don't try to multitask while working on your classwork
* Turn off autocompletion in your development environment
* Don't copy/paste code directly into your program.  Instead, type it - it will take longer, but it will also give you the time to study each line and develop and understanding of what it is doing and how it interacts with the rest of the program.
* Read programs written by other people, and try to understand what they are doing - [GitHub](https://github.com) is a great source of examples, and you can filter it by programming language
