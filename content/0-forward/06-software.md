For this course, we will be using a number of software packages including:
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
* Microsoft Visio 2019
* Xamarin Workbooks 

These have been installed in the classroom lab, as well as all Engineering and Computer Science labs.  It is strongly suggested that you install the same versions on your own development machines if you plan on working from home.  Alternatively, you can _remote desktop_ into a lab computer and use the installed software there.

## Remote Desktop Access
To use a remote desktop, you must first install a remote desktop client on your computer. Microsoft supplies a client for most platforms, which you can find links to and information about [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

The remote desktop server is behind a network firewall, so when accessing it from off-campus, you must be using the K-State Virtual Private Network (VPN).  It has its own client that also must be installed.  You can learn about K-State's VPN and download the client on [K-State's VPN Page](https://www.k-state.edu/its/security/secure-data/vpn/)

For remote desktop servers, you can use either those maintained by [The Department of Computer Science](https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Remote_Access) or the [College of Engineering](https://cecs.engg.ksu.edu/labs/vdi).

## Installing on Your Machine
If you would prefer to install the software on your own development machine, you can obtain no-cost copies of Microsoft Visual Studio Professional Edition and Microsoft Visio through Microsoft's [Azure Portal](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools) and signing in with your K-State eid and password. 

After signing in, click the "Software" option in the left menu, and browse the available software for what you need.  

The Visual Studio Community Edition is also available as a free download [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). While not as full-featured as the Professional edition you can download through Azure Portal, it will be sufficient for the needs of this class.

Xamarin Workbooks is a free tool and can be downloaded from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/tools/workbooks/install).

## RocketChat
The CS Department's RocketChat server can be accessed as a web-based app from [https://chat.cs.ksu.edu](https://chat.cs.ksu.edu).

In addition, RocketChat offers free desktop and mobile client apps you can download from [here](https://rocket.chat/install/).  Once installed, they will prompt you for a server address to connect to.  Use the CS Departmental server address: [https://chat.cs.ksu.edu](https://chat.cs.ksu.edu).
