This textbook was authored for the **CIS 400 - Object-Oriented Design, Implementation, and Testing** course at Kansas State University.  This front matter is specific to that course.  If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.

For this course, we will be using a number of software packages including:
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
* Microsoft Visio 2019
* Xamarin Workbooks 

These have been installed in the classroom lab, as well as all Engineering and Computer Science labs.  It is strongly suggested that you install the same versions on your own development machines if you plan on working from home.  Alternatively, you can _remote desktop_ into a lab computer and use the installed software there.

## Remote Desktop Access
To use a remote desktop, you must first install a remote desktop client on your computer. Microsoft supplies a client for most platforms, which you can find links to and information about [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

The remote desktop server is behind a network firewall, so when accessing it from off-campus, you must be using the K-State Virtual Private Network (VPN).  It has its own client that also must be installed.  You can learn about K-State's VPN and download the client on [the K-State VPN Page](https://www.k-state.edu/its/security/secure-data/vpn/)

For remote desktop servers, you can use either those maintained by [The Department of Computer Science](https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Remote_Access) or the [College of Engineering](https://cecs.engg.ksu.edu/labs/vdi).

## Installing on Your Machine
If you would prefer to install the software on your own development machine, you can obtain no-cost copies of Microsoft Visual Studio Professional Edition and Microsoft Visio through Microsoft's [Azure Portal](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools) and signing in with your K-State eid and password. 

After signing in, click the "Software" option in the left menu, and browse the available software for what you need.  

The Visual Studio Community Edition is also available as a free download [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). While not as full-featured as the Professional edition you can download through Azure Portal, it will be sufficient for the needs of this class.

## Discord
Discord can be used through its web app at [https://discord.com/webapp](https://discord.com/webapp) or you can [download a native app](https://discord.com/download) for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, or Android devices.

## Xamarin Workbooks
Xamarin Workbooks is a note-taking app with built-in C# processing (similar to the Jupyter notebooks you used in CIS 115).  You can download the installer [directly from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/workbooks), and scroll down to the Resources section of the README - there's a link to "Download latest public release for Windows".
