### Course Overview
A study of concepts and techniques used to produce quality software programs. Object-oriented concepts, models, execution environments, design and testing techniques. Extensive application of these concepts and techniques to the development of non-trivial software programs.

### Course Description
This course is focused on helping you to learn the concepts and skills needed to develop high-quality software. Along the way you will have ample opportunities to practice these skills developing non-trivial software projects. These are not the “baby programs” of early CS coursework, but rather applications that could be used in a production environment.

Accordingly, our goal is not just to write software that compiles without errors, but to develop **_well-written and maintainable software_**. This goal demands extra attention to design, documentation, and testing. Additionally, we will explore some of the powerful features of the
C# Language and the Visual Studio compiler, as well as other professional tools like Git and Visio.

### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, we expect each student to be able to:
* Create class definitions that 1) utilize **encapsulation** to organize related data and
behavior, 2) prevent uncontrolled internal state changes through **data hiding**, and 3)
allow outside code controlled interactions through **message passing**.
* **Specify** expected object behavior and verify it through creating and executing **unit tests**
against a class definition.
* Utilize **polymorphism** in the form of **inheritance** to minimize code duplication by moving shared fields and methods to a common ancestor.
* Reason about **dynamic dispatch** to determine what version of a polymorphic function or method will be invoked at runtime.
* Utilize **developer tools** like Visual Studio and Git to develop software reliably and efficiently.

### Major Course Topics
* Encapsulation and data hiding
* Message passing
* Polymorphism and inheritance
* Dynamic Dispatch
* Event-based programming
* Testing
* Debugging
* Software Versioning
* Code Modularization

### Course Structure
A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is **_“(s)he who does the work does the learning.”_** What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don’t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas,
practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.

This course is built around learner-centered teaching and its recognition of the role and
importance of these different aspects of learning. Most class periods will consist of short lectures interspersed with a variety of hands-on activities built around the concepts and skills we are seeking to master. In addition, we will be applying these ideas in iteratively building a series of related software applications over the course of the semester. Part of our class time will be reserved for working on these applications, giving you the chance to ask questions and receive feedback from your instructors, UTAs, and classmates.

### The Work
There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer. Only by **_doing the work_** will you develop the skills and knowledge to make your a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.

_Tutorials_
Each module will include many tutorial assignments that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique.  The point is not simply to complete the tutorial, but to _practice_ the technique and coding involved.  You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in the milestone assignment of the module - so this practice helps prepare you for those assignments.

_Milestone Programming Assignments_
Throughout the semester you will be building a non-trivial software project iteratively; every week a new milestone (a collection of features embodying a new version of a software application) will be due. Each milestone builds upon the prior milestone’s code base, so it is critical that you complete each milestone in a timely manner! This process also reflects the way software development is done in the real world - breaking large projects into more readily achievable milestones helps manage the development process.

Following along that real-world theme, programming assignments in this class will also be graded according to their conformance to coding style, documentation, and testing requirements. Each milestone’s rubric will include points assigned to each of these factors. It is not enough to simply write code that compiles and meets the specification; good code is readable, maintainable, efficient, and secure. The principles and practices of Object-Oriented programming that we will be learning in this course have been developed specifically to help address these concerns.

_Exams_
Over the course of the semester we will have a total of four exams. The primary purpose of these exams is formative; they are intended to help us (me as the instructor and you as the student) evaluate how you are learning the material. Thus, my testing policies may differ greatly from your prior courses.

These exams will cover the vocabulary and concepts we are learning and involve reasoning about object-oriented programming, including some code writing. The purpose of this style of assessment to assess your ability to recognize the problem and conceive an appropriate solution.  Hence, you are encouraged to annotate your answers with comments, describing your reasoning as you tackle the problem. Additionally, I will include a “certainty scale” for each question, and would ask that you mark how confident you are in your answer. Doing these extra steps helps me know how well you are grasping the material, and helps both of us to know what concepts and skills may need more work.

The first exam is a _pretest_ that is used to help establish your knowledge and readiness coming into the course.  You will earn a **100%** for completing this exam, regardless of your correct or incorrect responses.

The second two exams are _midterms_, which cover the content immediately proceeding them. You will have a chance to correct mistakes you have made in thee exams, potentially earning back your full points.

The _final_ exam is comprehensive, and covers the most important topics and skills we have developed in the course.  This is considered a _summative_ test (one that measures your mastery of a subject).  It will count for twice the number of points as the earlier exams, and you will not have a chance to correct mistakes made on it.

### Grading
In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total out of the possible number of points. In this course, it is perfectly possible to get an A simply by completing all the software milestones in a satisfactory manner and attending and participating in class each day. In such a case, the examinations will simply reflect the learning you’ve been doing through that work. Each work category constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:

30% - Activities, Tutorials, and Quizzes (The lowest 4 scores are dropped)

36% - Programming Assignment Milestones (3.6% each, 11 milestones total)
(The single lowest assignment score will be dropped)

34% - Exams (6.8% each, with the final worth double at 13.6; 4 exams total)

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:
90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F

At the end of the semester, for students who have earned a borderline grade (i.e. a 89.98%, which is a B), I will bump their grade to the next highest letter grade based on the student’s completion of exam annotations and confidence ratings on exam questions. That is to say, if the example student regularly gives detailed annotations of their thought process, and rates their confidence in their answer, I will bump their 89.98% to an A. Students who do not provide annotations and confidence ratings will not be bumped, for any reason.

### Collaboration
Collaboration is an important practice for both learning and software development. As such, you are encouraged to work with peers and seek out help from your instructors and UTAs. However, it is also critical to remember that **_(s)he who does the work, does the learning._**  Relying too much on your peers will deny you the opportunity to learn yourself. As the skills we
are working on are the foundations on which all future computer science coursework relies, any skills you fail to develop in this course can have long-ranging effects on your future success, in both classes and the working world.

Determining where the line between good collaboration and overreliance on others can be
challenging, especially as a student. I offer a few guidelines that can help:
1.  If you can’t yet put a concept into your own words and explain it to someone not versed in programming, you do not yet have a full grasp of the concept. Don’t be tempted to use someone else's words - keep working at it until you can use your own. But “working at it” in this context can mean seeking out additional explanations from other people. Sometimes getting enough different perspectives on a concept is what you need to be
able to synthesize your own.
2. Directly copying another student’s code and turning it in as your own work is never acceptable. It is a form of plagiarism and constitutes academic dishonesty and can result in severe penalties (covered below). This does not mean you can’t discuss the assignment and approaches to solving it with your peers - in fact doing so is often a useful learning practice. Just keep those discussions above the code level.
3. As a corollary to point 2, it is okay to ask another student to look at your code when you are struggling with syntax or errors. However, don’t let them correct it for you - let them offer suggestions but make any changes yourself. The act of making these changes actually contributes to the stimulus your brain is using to develop programming skills. So don’t let others shortchange your opportunity to learn (including instructors and UTAs).

### Late Work
{{% notice warning %}}
Read the late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructor via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won't apply to you!
{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. Late work will receive a penalty of 10% of the possible points for each day it is late. Missed class attendance cannot be made up, though as mentioned above some areas will drop the lowest two scores. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.

### Software
We will be using Visual Studio 2019 as our development environment. You can download a free copy of Visual Studio Community for your own machine at
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). You should also be able to get a professional
development license through your Azure Student Portal. See the CS support documentation for details: [https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/FAQ#MSDNAA](https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/FAQ#MSDNAA)

Additionally, we will create UML diagrams using Microsoft Visio, which can also be downloaded from the Azure Student Portal (see above).

We will use Xamarin workbooks to distribute some content. This free software can be downloaded from: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/tools/workbooks/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/tools/workbooks/install)

RocketChat also offers some free desktop and mobile clients that you may prefer over the web client.  You may download them from: [https://rocket.chat/install/](https://rocket.chat/install/).


### Recommended Texts & Supplies
To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.

This course offers an instructor-written textbook, which is broken up into a specific reading order and interleaved with activities and quizzes in the modules. It can also be directly accessed at [{{< param textbookURL >}}]({{< param textbookURL >}}).

Students who would like additional textbooks should refer to resources available on the [O'Riley For Higher Education](https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university) digital library offered by the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.

### Subject to Change
The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.

### Academic Honesty
Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the [Honor and Integrity System](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/) apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

**For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course.**

In this course, _unauthorized aid_ broadly consists of _giving or receiving code to complete assignments_.  This could be code you share with a classmate, code you have asked a third party to write for you, or code you have found online or elsewhere.  

Authorized aid - which is not a violation of the honor policy - includes
using the code snippets provided in the course materials, discussing strategies and techniques with classmates, instructors, TAs, and mentors. Additionally, you may use code snippets and algorithms found in textbooks and web sources if you clearly label them with comments indicating where the code came from and how it is being used in your project.

### Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](accesscenter@k-state.edu), 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Academic and Student Services at [polytechnicadvising@ksu.edu](polytechnicadvising@ksu.edu) or call 785-826-2674.

### Diversity and Inclusion
{{% notice note %}}
This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from [this statement](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/1625) created by two educators at Brown University. We feel that a statement such as this is very powerful and important in today’s world, and we’ll do our best to live up to it. 
{{% /notice %}}

In an ideal world, science and technology would be objective. However, much of science and technology is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will reference many materials from a diverse set of sources, but limits still exist on this diversity. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a technical nature.

Please contact me or submit anonymous feedback through the Computer Science department office if you have any concerns or suggestions regarding this course and related materials.

### Netiquette
{{% notice note %}}
This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from [this statement](https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/) from K-State Global Campus, and the [Recurse Center Manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual). We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.

Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the context and body language of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker means, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.

Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as email or Canvas:

* **Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.** Subject lines such as “Question” or “Problem” are not helpful. Subjects such as “Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java” or “Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python” give plenty of information about your topic.
* **Use only one topic per message.** If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.
* **Be thorough, concise, and to the point.** Ideally, each message should be a page or less.
* **Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.** It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you’ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.
* **Consider carefully what you write before you post it.** Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.
* **If you are lost, don’t know an answer, or don’t understand something, speak up!** Email allows you to send a message privately to the instructors. Don’t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.
* **Class discussions are confidential.** Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.
Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts. When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.
* **Do not use all caps.** It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.
* **No feigning surprise.** If someone asks a question, saying things like “I can’t believe you don’t know that!” are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.
* **No “well-actually’s."** If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a “well, actually…” correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don’t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.
* **Do not correct someone’s grammar or spelling.** Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.
* **Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.** Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.
* **Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.** They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.

### Expectations of Conduct 
All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the [Student Judicial Conduct Code](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/) as outlined in the Student Governing Association [By Laws](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf), Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

### Face Coverings
To protect the health and safety of the K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face coverings over their mouths and noses while on K-State campuses in all hallways, public spaces, classrooms and other common areas of campus buildings, and when in offices or other work spaces or outdoor settings when 6-feet social distancing cannot be maintained. In addition, all students, faculty, and staff are required to take the [COVID-19 and Face Mask Safety training](https://www.k-state.edu/safety/covid-19/training/). Employees who need reasonable accommodations and assistance related to required face coverings may contact the ADA coordinator at [charlott@k-state.edu](mailto:charlott@k-state.edu), and students needing accommodations may contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](accesscenter@k-state.edu).

In classrooms, faculty have the right to deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face covering. Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available. If the student does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the space, and if available, join the class remotely.  As a last resort, campus police will be called. The faculty members will complete the [Code of Conduct form](https://www.k-state.edu/report/conduct-violation/) and the Office of Student Life will look further into the issue and take the non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of further accountability measures. 

At no point should the professor or other students put themselves into an unsafe situation while attempting to enforce the face-covering policy. Manhattan campus police: 785-532-6412

### Campus Safety
Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. To view additional campus emergency information go to the University’s main page, [www.k-state.edu](http://www.k-state.edu/), and click on the Emergency Information button, located at the bottom of the page.

### Student Resources
K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college, student life, health and safety, and others found at [www.k-state.edu/onestop](http://www.k-state.edu/onestop).

### Academic Freedom Statement
Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university’s mission.

Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.
