This textbook was authored for the **CIS 400 - Object-Oriented Design, Implementation, and Testing** course at Kansas State University.  This front matter is specific to that course.  If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.

This course is taught in the "flipped" style.  This means you will be watching videos and working through totorials _before_ you come to class.  Your class sessions will be for working on and getting help with your projects.

### The Big Software Solution
Up to this point, you've likely done a lot of what I like to call "Baby Projects" - programming projects that are useful to demonstrate a concept or technique, but really don't do anything beyond that.  In contrast, we'll be building a large, multi-project software solution to meet a real-world problem - the software needed to run a fast-food franchise chain, the _Bleakwood Buffet_.  

We'll be building this software _iteratively_ over the entire semester!  Each week, you'll turn in one milestone as a GitHub release, just like you might do as a professional software developer.  Because each milestone builds upon your prior work, it is critical that you keep up.  Falling behind will very quickly tank your grade.

### Weekly Modules
The course is organized into weekly modules focused on a specific topic.  Each module introduces one or more topics, and 1) covering the vocabulary and concepts with assigned readings, 2) puts those concepts into practice with guided tutorials, and 3) tasks you with applying those techniques you just practiced in a weekly milestone.  

The modules, and all of their associated assignments, are available through Canvas.  All module work is due at the end of the week (or occasionally mid-week). But be aware that if you procrastinate and don't start until the weekend, it is unlikely that you will finish. Which means you will fall behind.  You can very quickly find yourself in a hole you cannot climb out of.  So time management is a _critical_ skill you need to be developing.  

{{% notice warning %}}
Remember that in the CS Professional Program, a grade of less than C in a professional program course (like CIS 400) results in a "Warning of Unsatisfactory Progress."  This warning sticks with you the rest of your time at K-State. If you earn a second, similar grade, you will be dismissed from the CS Professional Program!

### Class Meetings
Due to the COVID-19 classroom capacity restrictions, not all students in the course can be physically in the classroom at the same time.   Accordingly, the students in the course will be divided into three groups: I, II, and III. 

* Group I will meet Mondays
* Group II will meet Wednesdays
* Group III will meet on Fridays.

Please only come during your assigned day!

You can verify your group by visiting the Canvas page, clicking the **People** menu option, and then the **Groups** tab.

I will be sending a survey _before_ the start of the semester to determine students' preferred group.  Students will be placed in groups based on available space and the order thier request was recieved in.

The CS Scholars section will be split into groups, as it is small enough to fit into the classroom safely.  Scholars still have the choice of attending in-person or remotely.

Also, if you realize your group meeting time is not working for you, let me know.  It may be possible to switch.

Attendance at the class meetings is not manditory.  If you are uncomfortable coming to the classroom, you do not need to.

### Joining Remotely
Class meetings will also be broadcast over zoom, should you want to join a session that you are not attending in-person. These meetings can be accessed from the **Zoom** Menu option in Canvas.

You may join **any** class session via Zoom, either section, any day.  Please maintain good netiquitte while in a class Zoom session.
