This course is taught in the "flipped" style.  This means you will be watching videos and working through tutorials _before_ you come to class.  Your class sessions will be for working on and getting help with your projects.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this course has been structured so that there is **never** a need to attend in-person, though we have strived to keep as much possibility of face-to-face contact as possible.  This way, if you need to isolate, you have the freedom to do so without concern for falling behind.

### The Big Software Solution
Up to this point, you've likely done a lot of what I like to call "Baby Projects" - programming projects that are useful to demonstrate a concept or technique, but really don't do anything beyond that.  In contrast, we'll be building a large, multi-project software solution to meet a real-world problem - the software needed to run a fast-food franchise chain, the _{{< param ProjectName >}}_.  

We'll be building this software _iteratively_ over the entire semester!  Each week, you'll turn in one milestone as a GitHub release, just like you might do as a professional software developer.  Because each milestone builds upon your prior work, it is critical that you keep up.  Falling behind will very quickly tank your grade.

### Modules
The course is organized into modules focused on a specific topic, accessible from the Canvas **modules** menu.  Each module introduces one or more topics, and 1) covering the vocabulary and concepts with assigned readings, 2) puts those concepts into practice with guided tutorials, and 3) tasks you with applying those techniques you just practiced in a weekly milestone.  

The modules, and all of their associated assignments, are available through Canvas.  You must complete each module item _in order_, and the prior week's modules must be finished before you can move on to those in the next week. Be aware that if you procrastinate and don't start until Friday, it is unlikely that you will finish. Which means you will fall behind.  You can very quickly find yourself in a hole you cannot climb out of.  So time management is a _critical_ skill you need to be developing.

Remember that in the CS Professional Program, a grade of **less than C** in a professional program course (like CIS 400) results in a "**Warning of Unsatisfactory Progress**."  This warning sticks with you the rest of your time at K-State. If you earn a second, similar grade, you will be dismissed from the CS Professional Program!

### Class Meetings
As we are operating in a "flipped" classroom style, class times are _when you should be working on your homework_ and _asking the questions you have about the course content_.  This means you should have your readings and exercises done _before_ the class meeting and be prepared and ready to work on your milestones!  In other words, class sessions are essentially _help sessions_ - think of them as extended office hours/a recitation period.

Due to the COVID-19 classroom capacity restrictions, not all students in the course can be physically in the classroom at the same time.  We are therefore making the following adjustments to class meetings:

* All class meetings will be broadcast live via Zoom.  You are welcome to join any class meeting (either section A or B) remotely.  The links will be posted to the **Zoom** tab on Canvas:

* All class meetings will likewise be recorded - so you can go back and review the discussion.  These recordings will also be available under the **Zoom** tab in Canvas.

* Only Monday class meetings will be held in-person; other days will be held only via Zoom.  Students wishing to attend a class session in-person will need to sign up using the provided application.  This is done on a weekly basis. _Note: If no one signs up for the in-person class meeting, that class meeting will be held entirely online_.
