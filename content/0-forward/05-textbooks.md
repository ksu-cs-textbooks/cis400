This course does not have a required print textbook.  The resources presented in the modules are also organized into an online textbook that can be accessed here: [{{< param textbookURL >}}]({{< param textbookURL >}}).  You may find this a useful reference if you prefer a traditional textbook layout.  Additionally, since the textbook exists outside of Canvas' access control, you can continue to utilize it after the course ends.

Please note that the materials presented in Canvas have additional graded assignments and exercises worked into the reading order that do not appear in the online edition of the textbook.  You are responsible for completing these!

### CS Departmental Textbook Server
The CIS 400 course textbook is only one of several textbooks authored by your instructors and made available on the departmental server.  For example, your CIS 300 textbook is also available there for you to go back and review.  You can access any of these textbooks at the site <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu" target="_blank">https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu</a>

### O'Riley for Higher Education

If you are looking for additional resources to support your learning, a great resource that is available to Kansas State University students is the [O'Riley For Higher Education](https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university) digital library offered through the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of thousands of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.  As of this writing, a search for object-orientation returns 13,237 results and C# returns 5,984 results.  In particular, I would recommend these books:

* "[The Object-Oriented Thought Process](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-object-oriented-thought/9780135182130/)" by Matt Weisfeld for learning more about object-orientation.
* "[Mastering Windows Presentation Foundation](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-windows-presentation/9781838643416/)" by Sheridan Yuen for learning about WPF.
* "[xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/xunit-test-patterns/9780131495050/)" by Gerard Meszaros for learning about the xUnit framework.

There are likewise materials for other computer science topics you may have an interest in - it is a great resource for all your CS coursework.  It costs you nothing (technically, your access was paid for by your tuition and fees), so you might as well make use of it!
