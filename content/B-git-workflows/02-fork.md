Forking a project creates a new copy of a project on GitHub under your account. Because the original project and your fork share a common history, you can set the original project as an _upstream_ repository.

## Step 1 - Create the Fork
You fork a project in Github by clicking the "fork" button on the original project repository page:

![forking on GitHub]({{<static "images/b.2.1.png">}})

This will clone the project into a new Github repository under your account.  The webpage will redirect to your project's page once done.

## Notes
You can [clone]({{<ref "B-git-workflows/03-clone">}}) the forked project to your local machine(s) where you can work on it.  You can create as many of these clones as you need.
