In this class, we will be working with Git, GitHub, and GitHub classroom. You have likely already used both of these tools in prior courses, but probably only at a surface level.  In this course, we will begin to explore and utilize Git in more detail, much as you would in professional practice.


In this class, we will be working with multiple git repositories, much the way you would in professional practice. These repositories will all share a common history (i.e. they are clones). We’ll give two of them special names: upstream and origin. In addition, you may have multiple local clones as well - typically one for each machine you develop on.

* **upstream** is the repository I have created with the framework of our project in it. 
* **origin** is your clone of the upstream repository that is hosted on GitHub, created through GitHub Classroom. Your local repositories will be cloned from this one.
* **local** you will have at least one local repository where you update your code to meet the assignments’ requirements. It is possible you may have multiple local repos - for example, one on the lab computer, and one on your desktop at home.

## Workflows
* [Cloning your origin repository]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/03-clone" %}}) to create a local repository.
* [Committing changes]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/05-commit" %}}) in a local repository.
* [Pushing changes]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/06-push" %}}) in a local repository to your origin repository.
* [Pulling changes]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/07-pull" %}}) from your origin repository to your local repository.
* [Resolving merge conflicts]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/08-merge-conflicts" %}}) after a merge or pull.
* [Creating a release]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/09-release" %}})
* [Ignoring files]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/10-ignoring-files" %}}) with a _.gitignore_ file.
* [Adding documentation files]({{% ref "b-git-workflows/11-adding-documentation-files" %}}) to your repository.
