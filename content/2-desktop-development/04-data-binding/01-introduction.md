The term *data binding* refers to binding two objects together programmatically so that one has access to the data of the other.  We most commonly see this with user interfaces and data objects - the user interface _exposes_ some of the state of the data object to the user.  As with many programming tasks, there are a number of ways to approach data binding.  The Windows Presentation Foundation in C# has adopted an event and component-based approach that we will explore in this chapter.
