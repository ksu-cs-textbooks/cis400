In this chapter we looked at some of the challenges of testing GUIs, and saw why most GUI applications are still manually tested.  We also explored the process of writing a _test plan_, a step-by-step process for a human tester to follow to provide rigor in the testing process. 

We also explored the Model View ViewModel architecture in more depth, especially how it can allow us to move complex logic out of our GUI into a simple class that can be unit tested.
