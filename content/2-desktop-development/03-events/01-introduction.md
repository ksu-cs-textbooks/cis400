Event-Driven programming is a programming paradigm where the program primarily responds to events - typically generated by a user, but also potentially from sensors, network connections, or other sources.  We cover it here because event-driven programming is a staple of graphical user interfaces.  These typically display a fairly static screen until the user interacts with the program in some meaningful way - moving or clicking the mouse, hitting a key, or the like.

As you might suspect, event-driven programming is often used alongside other programming paradigms, including structured programming and object-orientation.  We'll be exploring how event-driven programming is implemented in C# in this chapter, especially how it interacts with Windows Presentation Foundation.
