In this chapter, we introduced a new desktop application programming framework - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).  We explored how WPF uses XAML to define partial classes, allowing for a graphical design editor with regular C# codebehind.  We explored XAML syntax and many of the controls found in WPF.  We also compared WPF with Windows Forms, which you have previously explored in pior classes.  Finally, we discussed an approach to developing GUIs, _Component-Based Design_, which applies the Single Responsiblity Principle to controls, and builds more complex controls through _composition_ of these simpler controls.
