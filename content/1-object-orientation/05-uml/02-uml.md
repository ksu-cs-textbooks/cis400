[Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://www.uml.org/) was introduced to create a standardized way of visualizing a software system design.  It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbah at Rational Software in the mid-nineties.  It was adopted as astandard by the Object Management Group in 1997, and aslo by the International Organization for Stanardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard in 2005.

The UML standard actuall provides many different kinds of diagrams for describing a software system - both structure and behavior:

* __Class Diagram__ A class diagram visualizes the structure of the classes in the software, and the relationships between these classes.
* __Component Diagram__ A component diagram visualizes how the software system is broken into _components_, and how communication between those components is achieved.
* __Activity Diagram__ An activity diagram represents workflows in a step-by-step process for actions.  It is used to model data flow in a software system.
* __Use-Case Diagram__ A use-case diagram identifies the kinds of users a software system will have, and how they work with the software.
* __Sequence Diagram__ A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in chronological sequences.
* __Communication Diagram__ A communication diagram models the interactions between objects in terms of sequences of messages.

The [full UML specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1/PDF) is _754 pages long_, so there is a _lot_ of information packed into it.  For the purposes of this class, we're focusing on a single kind of diagram - the _class diagram_.
