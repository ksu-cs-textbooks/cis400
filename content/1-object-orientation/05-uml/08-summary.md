In this section, we learned about UML class diagrams, a langauge-agnostic approach to visualizing the structure of an object-oriented software system.  We saw how individual classes are represented by boxes divided into three compartments; the first for the identity of the class, the second for its attributes, and the third for its operators. We learned that italics are used to indicate abstract classes and operators, and underlining static classes, attributes, and operators.

We also saw how associations between classes can be represented by arrows with specific characteristics, and examined four of these in detail: aggregation, composition, generalization, and realization.  We also learned how multiplicities can show the number of instances invovled in these associations.

Finally, we saw how C# classes, interfaces, and enumerations are modeled using UML.  We saw how the sterotype can be used to indicate langauge-specific features like C# properties.  We also looked at creating UML Class diagrams using Microsoft Visio.
