One of the many tools we can use to create UML diagrams is Microsoft Visio.  For Kansas State University Computer Science students, this can be downloaded through your [Azure Student Portal](https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/FAQ#MSDNAA).

Visio is a vector graphics editor for creating flowcharts and diagrams.  it comes preloaded with a UML class diagram template, which can be selected when creating a new file:

Class diagrams are built by dragging shapes from the shape toolbox onto the drawing surface.  Notice that the shapes include classes, interfaces, enumerations, and all the associations we have discussed. Once in the drawing surface, these can be resized and editied.

Right-clicking on an association will open a context menu, allowing you to turn on multiplicites.  These can be edited by double-clicking on them.  Unneeded multiplicities can be deleted.

To export a Visio project in PDF or other form, choose the "Export" option from the file menu.
