Throughout the earlier chapters, we've focused on the theoretical aspects of Object-Orientation, and discussed how those are embodied in the C# language.  Before we close this section though, it would be a good idea to recognize that C# is not _just_ an object-oriented language, but actually draws upon many ideas and syntax approaches that are not very object-oriented at all!

In this chapter, we'll examine many aspects of C# that fall outside of the object-oriented mould. Understanding how and why these constructions have entered C# will help make you a better programmer, and hopefully alleviate any confusion you might have.
