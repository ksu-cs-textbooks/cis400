A critical part of the software development process is _ensuring the software works!_  We mentioned earlier that it is possible to logically prove that software works by constructing a state transition table for the program, but once a program reaches a certain size this strategy becomes less feasible.  Similarly, it is possible to model a program mathematically and construct a theorem that _proves_ it will perform as intended.  But in practice, most software is validated through some form of _testing_.  This chapter will discuss the process of testing object-oriented systems.

## Key Terms

## Key Skills

The key skill to learn in this chapter is how to write C# unit test code using [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) and the Visual Studio [Test Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2019).
