In this chapter, we looked at how Object-Orientation adopted the concept of encapsulation to combine related state and behavior within a single unit of code, known as a class.  We further explored how objects are instances of a class created through invoking a constructor method.  

We also discussed several different ways of looking at and reasoning about objects - as a state machine, and as structured data stored in memory.  We discussed how a method is really a form of message passing that provides an interface to interact with objects safely.

Finally, we explored how all of these concepts are implemented in the C# language.
