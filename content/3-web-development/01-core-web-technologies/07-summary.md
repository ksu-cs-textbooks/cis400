In this chapter we explored the three client-side core web technologies: HTML, which defines the content of a web page; CSS, which defines the appearance of the web page; and Javascript, which adds interactivity to the web page.  We also examined Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which is used to transmit web pages from the server to the client.  We learned that HTTP always follows a request-response pattern, and how both requests and responses are simply streams of data that follow a specific layout.

With this basic understanding of the web client files, and the means to transmit them to the client, we are ready to tackle creating a web server, which we will do in the next chapter.
