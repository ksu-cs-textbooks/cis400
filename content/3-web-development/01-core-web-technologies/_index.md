The World-Wide Web was the brainchild of [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee).  It was conceived as a way to share information across the Internet; in Sir Berners-Lee's own words describing the idea as he first concieved it:

>  This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty whatsoever. However, **it could start a revolution in information access.**

Clearly that revolution has come to pass.  The web has become part of our daily lives. 

There were three key technologies that Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed and developed.  These remain the foundations upon which the web runs even today.  Two are client-side, and determine how web pages are interpreted by browsers.  These are:

* Hyper-Text Markup Language 
* Cascading Style Sheets 

They are joined with a third key client-side technology, which began as a scripting langauge developed by [Brendon Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) to add interactivity to web pages in the Netscape Navigator.

* JavaScript

You have already studied each of these core client-side web technologies in CIS 115, and used them to create your own personal web pages.

The other foundational web technology created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the communication protocol used to request and transmit web pages and other files across the Internet:

* Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol

We will review each of these technologies breifly, before we see how ASP.NET builds upon them to deliver web applications.
