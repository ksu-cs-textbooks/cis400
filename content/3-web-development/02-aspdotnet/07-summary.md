In this chapter we explored how server-side web technologies have evolved to create _dynamic_ web sites and web applications.  The ASP.NET Core platform is Microsoft's answer to this evolution.  It can run on either Microsoft's flagship IIS server, or as a stand-alone server on a variety of platforms.  It brings together a suite of technologies to build web pages and web applications.  We took an in-depth look at one of these - Razor pages, and learned how to build our own Razor pages app.
