While web browsers request resources (including HTTP, CSS, and JavaScript) files over HTTP, the other end of this connection, and what supplies those files, is a _web server_.  Unlike web clients, which are limited by what technologies a browser understands (namely HTML, CSS, and JS), a web server can be written in any programming language.  In this chapter, we will explore writing web servers in C#, using aspects of the ASP.NET framework.
