Now that we have explored some ideas about getting data _from_ the web server, let's turn our attention to sending data _to_ the webserver.  One of the earliest approaches for doing so is to use a HTML form sent as a HTTP Request, which we'll take a look at in this chapter.

## Key Terms

Some key terms to learn in this chapter are:
* Form
* Input
* Encoding
* `Nullable<T>` and `?`

And the HTML tags:
* `<form>`
* `<input>`
* `<textarea>`
