In this chapter we looked at how data is handled in web applications.  We saw how forms can be used to submit data to our server, and examined several common encoding strategies.  We also saw how we can retrieve this data in our Razor Pages - through the `Request` object, or by parameter or model binding. Finally, we discussed validating submitted values, on both the client and server side of a HTTP request.

You should now be able to handle creating web forms and processing the submitted data.
