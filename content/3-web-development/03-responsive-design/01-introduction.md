Modern websites are displayed on a wide variety of devices, everything from a traditional monitor, the printed page, cell phones, to TV screens.  For each of these we may want to display the page in different ways.  Rather than writing a brand-new page, we can use CSS rules that apply only in certain conditions.  This allows us to use the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for _all_ devices, and have the rendered web page appear in an appropriate fashion.

In this chapter we will explore several strategies for using these rules to create _responsive_ webpages, that is, webpages that _respond_ to the kind of device they are being displayed on by selectively applying CSS rules.  As we learn, we'll be modifying a starter project to use these rules to become responsive.


## Initial Project
The initial project we'll be modifying is a simple ASP.NET web app using razor pages to display a simple `Index` page divided into three sections, plus a banner ad and some navigation.

You can clone the starting project from the GitHub Classroom url provided in the Canvas Assignment (for students in the CIS 400 course), or directly from the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ksu-cis/responsive-starter.git) (for other readers).
