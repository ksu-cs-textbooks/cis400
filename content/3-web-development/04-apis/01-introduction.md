Not all web applications are built to be viewed in a browser.  Many are built to be used by other programs.  We call these web applications Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).  These also make HTTP or HTTPS requests against our apps, but usually instead of serving HTML, we serve some form of serialized data instead - most commonly XML or JSON.
