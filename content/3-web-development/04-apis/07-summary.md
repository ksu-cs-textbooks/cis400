In this chapter we explored using web APIs to retrieve data from remote servers. We saw how to use the `WebRequest` object to make this task approachable.  We also revisited ideas you've seen in prior courses like the `IDisposable` interface and `using` statements to work with unmanaged objects.  We saw how to consume XML data we receive as a response from a web API.  

We also discussed using `async` methods to allow our programs to continue to respond to user input and incoming web requests while processing long-running tasks in parallel.  Finally, we discussed RESTful routes, a standardized way of determining the routes for your web API.
