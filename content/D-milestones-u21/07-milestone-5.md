For this milestone, you will be adding functionality to your Point-of-Sale system (POS). Specifically, we will be adding support for putting together an order and customizing the elements within it.  To do this, we will be leveraging data binding.

### General requirements:

* You need to follow the style laid out in the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)

* All classes should be declared in their respective namespace (see below)

* Document your classes using XML-Style comments

* Create UML class diagrams to represent your project

### Assignment requirements:

* Implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface on all `IOrderItem` implementing classes

* Implement the `ICollection`, `INotifyPropertyChanged`, and `INotifyCollectionChanged` interface on the `Order` class

* Bind an `Order` instance to your `MainWindow`

* Create an event listener to cancel the order and tie it to the corresponding button

* Create event listener(s) to add items to your bound `Order` and open the corresponding customization screen, binding the item to the customization screen's `DataContext`

* Add event listeners to customize the bound `IOrderItem` in in the customization screen

* Bind the `OrderSummaryControl` UI controls to the corresponding `Order` properties to display the order details

* Provide a means for removing items from the order in your GUI

* Update your UML Class Diagrams to reflect the current state of both projects:
  * Data
  * PointOfSale

(You don't need to create a UML of your test project, though you can if you want)

### Purpose:

This assignment is intended to familiarize you to Microsoftâ€™s Windows Presentation Foundations' approach to events and data binding. Data Binding allows you to tie a user interface element to an object that provides its data, and enable one- or two-way flow for updating that data.

### Recommendations:

* Get in the habit of reading the entire assignment before you start to code. Make sure you understand what is being asked of you. Please do not stub your toe and have to redo work because you did not read the entire assignment.

* Accuracy is _important_.  Your class, property, enumeration and other names, along with the descriptions _must match the specification given here_.  Otherwise, your code is **not correct**.  While typos may be a small issue in writing intended for human consumption, in computer code _it is a big problem!_ 

* Remember that you must document your classes.  This includes a general identity comment at the top of your files, i.e.:

```csharp
/*
* Author: Nathan Bean
* Edited by: (Only include if you are not the original author)
* File name: Something.cs
* Purpose: To inform the students of the requirements for this milestone
*/
```
**AND** XML-Style comments above every public class, field, property, and method!

### Implement INotifyPropertyChanged on your Order Items

In order for an object to support WPF data binding, it needs to implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface from the `System.ComponentModel` namespace.  This requires you to:

1. Add a `PropertyChanged` event to your class 

2. Invoke that `PropertyChanged` event _any time a property of the class changes_, specifying the property that changed _by its exact name_ in the supplied `PropertyChangedEventArgs`

### Test the INotifyPropertyChanged functionality of your Order Items

To ensure that you've implemented the interface correctly, you should add unit tests to each of your order items to verify:

1. That the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface is implemented, and 

2. That all changing properties are notified.

The first can be accomplished with the `Assert.IsAssignableFrom<T>(Object obj)` assertion.  The second can be done with `Assert.PropertyChanged(Object obj, string propertyName, Action action)`.  For example, to test that the `CheddarCheese` property notifies of a change, we could:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void CheddarCheeseTriggersPropertyChanged()
{
  var dog = new Dog();
  // Since dog should have no cheddar cheese by default, we first set it to true
  Assert.propertyChanged(dog, "CheddarCheese", () => {
    // Inside the action, we make a change to the object that should trigger
    // the PropertyChanged event
    dog.CheddarCheese = true;
  });
  Assert.propertyChanged(dog, "CheddarCheese", () => {
    dog.CheddarCheese = false;
  });
}
```

### Implement interfaces on the Order class

We will be using the `Order` class as a collection of `IOrderItem`s.  This means we should implement the `ICollection<T>` interface, so we can treat it as a collection similar to `List`, `Dictionary`, and the other collections you have worked with previously.  We will also be data-binding to this list, which means it needs to implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface to update the GUI properly, and _also_ the `INotifyCollectionChanged` (as it is also a collection).

In addition to the interfaces, you will need to add a readonly `Number` property of type `uint` to your order. Its value should be set when the order is constructed, and not be changed after that.  Each successive order created should use a different number (preferably increasing by one).  This is most easily accomplished by declaring a private static variable to keep track of the next order number to use.

#### Implement the `ICollection<T>` interface on the Order class

The `Order` class will need to implement the [`ICollection<T>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.icollection-1?view=net-5.0) interface.  This is a generic collection interface which specifies methods that all collections should have.  It is also a _generic_ interface (hence the `<T>`), and we can either implement our own _generic_ collection on top of it, or (because we know we want a collection of `IOrderItems`) specify the collection type when we implement it, i.e.:

```csharp
public class Order : ICollection<IOrderItem> {
  // TODO: Class definition here
}
```

{{% notice info %}}
Alternatively, we can implement the `ICollection<T>` interface by _inheriting_ from a class that already implements it, like `List<T>` or `Collection<T>`.
{{% /notice %}}

To implement the `ICollection<T>` interface, you will need to define the following properties and methods on the `Order`:

* `Count` - a read-only `int` property that indicates how many items are in the order

* `IsReadOnly` - a read-only boolean that indicates if the collection can be changed after it is created.  As we want to add and remove items from the order, this will always be `false`.

* `Add(T)` - a method that adds an item (in our case, this would be a `IOrderItem`) to the collection.  You should already have written this method in the previous milestones.

* `Remove(T)` - a method that removes the specified item (in our case, an `IOrderItem`) from the collection.  It returns `true` if the item was removed, `false` otherwise.  You should already have written this method in a previous milestone.

* `Contains(T)` - method that returns `true` if the specified item is in the collection, `false` otherwise.

* `CopyTo(T[], int)` - Copies the number of items specified by the `int` the from the `Order` into the supplied `IOrderItem[]` array.

* `GetEnumerator<T>()` - The `ICollection<T>` interface also includes the `IEnumerable<T>` interface, so you will need to implement a method to get an Enumerator.

* `GetEnumerator()` - The `ICollection<T>` interface also includes the `IEnumerable` interface, so you will need to implement a method to get an Enumerator.

 
* Optional: It might be useful to implement the bracket operator `[]`, which allows access to a specific item at a specific position in the collection.  It is defined as an operator override, i.e.:

```csharp
public IOrderItem this[int index] { get; set; }
```

Note: You must provide implementations for `get` and `set`.

##### Hints

Many of these methods can be implemented as pass-through methods from the collection you are using internally to hold the order items (essentially, return the result of calling the same method on the collection).


#### Implement INotifyPropertyChanged on the Order class

Since you will be data binding the order, you will _also_ need to implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface on it.  You should notify when any of the order properties change, which are:

* `Size` - the count of items in the order

* `Subtotal` - the total cost of items in the order

* `Tax` - the amount of tax to be charged in the order

* `Total` - the subtotal and tax together 

If your `DateTime` and `Number` properties do not change, then there is no need to notify of them changing.  But if you _do_ allow it to change, you will also need to notify for it.

Note that if an item in the collection changes, i.e. a `Dog` in the order is modified to add additional ingredients, _its price will change_.  Therefore the `Subtotal`, `Tax`, and `Total` _order_ will change as well.  Thus, when items are added to the collection you will need to listen to their `PropertyChanged` event from the `Order` class and trigger your own `PropertyChanged` for these dependent properties!

##### Hints

Attaching a `PropertyChanged` event listener to the `IOrderItem` in your `Add()` method and detaching it in the `Remove()` method can fulfil the last requirement and ensure you don't have orphaned event listeners (and the corresponding memory leak).

#### Implement ICollectionChanged on the Order class

You will also need to implement the [INotifyCollectionChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.specialized.inotifycollectionchanged?view=net-5.0) interface in the `System.Collections.Specialized` namespace.  This interface is similar to the `INotifyPropertyChanged`, but adds specific requirements for when a _collection_ used as a data source changes, i.e when items are added or removed.

This interface requires you to implement one event, a `NotifyCollectionChanged` event:

```csharp
public event NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler CollectionChanged;
```

As you might imagine, this is triggered any time the collection changes.  It uses a corresponding event args, [NotifyPropertyChangedEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.specialized.notifycollectionchangedeventargs?view=net-5.0) which has multiple constructors.  You need to to utilize the appropriate one for the situation you are reporting:

* Adding a single item: `new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(CollectionChangedAction.Add, item)` where `item` is the item added

* Removing a single item `new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(CollectionChanged.Remove, item, index)` where `item` is the item removed, and `index` is an integer specifying the index it was located at.

* Changing the entire collection (i.e. on a clear): `new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(CollectionChanged.Reset)`

Using the appropriate event args allows the UI to update itself with the least amount of changes, making it more efficient.

### Test the INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyCollectionChanged, and ICollection functionality of your Order Items

You will need to write additional tests to ensure that your `Order` class's new functionality behaves as expected.  At a minimum, you should be testing:

* That adding an item triggers a corresponding `CollectionChanged` event

* That removing an item triggers a corresponding `CollectionChanged` event

* That adding an item triggers `PropertyChanged` events for each property that is changing (i.e. `Count`, `Subtotal`, `Tax`, and `Total`)

* That removing an item triggers `PropertyChanged` events for each property that is changing (i.e. `Count`, `Subtotal`, `Tax`, and `Total`)

* That modifying an item in the order triggers `PropertyChanged` events for each property that is changing (i.e. `Count`, `Subtotal`, `Tax`, and `Total`)

* That `Count` accurately reflects the number of items in the order

* That `IsReadOnly` is `false`


### Bind an Order instance to your MainWindow

Since the Point-of-Sale only deals with one order at a time, you can bind an instance of `Order` to the `MainWindow.DataContext` property and use it in any controls that are children of the `MainWindow` (provided they or their ancestors don't set their own `DataContext` property).

You can change this order at any time by replacing the current one with a new one, i.e. 

```csharp
DataContext = new Order();
```

You should implement this functionality for the "Cancel Order" button by writing an event listener and attaching it to the button.

### Add Items to the Order 

You should also add items to the bound `Order` instance when the buttons corresponding to that item are clicked.  You can do this with either a single event listener used by _all_ menu item buttons, or have individual event listeners for each one.  

As the `DataContext` of the `MenuItemSelection` control is received from the `MainWindow`, you can simply use it to access the order, i.e.:

```csharp
var order = DataContext as Order;
```

Note we have to _cast_ the data context (as it is stored as an `Object`).  If you are uncertain if the `DataContext` in this case is actually an order, you can use the pattern-match cast:

```csharp
if(DataContext is Order order) {
  // Inside this body, `order` is the DataContext cast to be an order
}
```

If the `DataContext` is _not_ an `order` instance, the true branch of this conditional statement is skipped.

If the item has a customization screen, this even listener should also display that control after the item is added to the order, to allow it to be customized.

### Customizing the Order Items

For those customization screens, you want to bind the specific order item instance as the `DataContext` so that you can data-bind the controls directly to the order item.  I.e. if our `DataContext` is a `Dog` class, we can bind a `<CheckBox>` control to its `YellowMustard` property with:

```xml
<CheckBox isChecked={Binding Path=YellowMustard}>Yellow Mustard</CheckBox>
```

If your data binding is set up correctly, the checkbox will reflect the current state of the `Dog.YellowMustard` property, and clicking it will update that state.

All of your customization screens need to be data bound this way.

#### Hint

It is easiest to bind the order item at the same time you display the customization screen, i.e. in the button click listener of the `MenuItemSelectionControl`.

Radio buttons are easiest to handle by restyling a `<List>` to use the radiobutton template.  Refer to the textbook section on [Binding Enums]({{<ref "2-desktop-development/04-data-binding/05-binding-enums">}}) for guidance on this process.

### Displaying the Order Properties

Likewise, you will want to data-bind the `Order` properties to your `OrderSummaryControl`, including the `Subtotal`, `Tax`, `Total`, `Number` and `DateTime`. These would be one-way bindings (as you don't want the user to be able to edit these values, as they are calculated from the order).  If you do this correctly, the values in the UI will update automatically as you make changes to the order.

You will also want to bind the `Order.Items` property to your `OrderSummaryControl`'s `<List>`, so that the individual order items are displayed.  However, if you use the default functionality the list will show the fully-qualified name of the class the item is, not the details we want.  Thus, you will need to replace the `<List>`'s `ItemTemplate` to use a custom `<DataTemplate>` you define.  This should display the item's name, price, and its special instructions.  

An example of what this might look like is displayed below:

![An example of the order summary list]({{<static "images/d.u21.7.1.png">}})

Refer to the textbook section on [Binding Lists]({{<ref "2-desktop-development/04-data-binding/04-binding-lists">}}) for guidance on this process.

### Removing Items from the Order

You need to allow the user to remove an item from the order.  The exact details of the implementation are left to you, but some possibilities are:

1. Adding a "remove" button to the list of order items in the `OrderSummaryControl`
2. Adding a "remove" button to the customization screen for each order item (note you may need to add additional customization screens)
3. Adding a "remove selected" button to the `OrderSummaryControl` that removes the currently selected item from the displayed order list

### XML Style Documentation
All public classes, properties, methods, fields, etc. in the `Data` and `PointOfSale` projects should be documented inline using UML-Style documentation, as covered in the [documentation chapter]{((<ref 03-documentation>))}.

### UML Class Diagram
You will need to update the UML Class Diagram for the `Data` project and the `PointOfSale` project, which should follow the guidelines set out in the [UML Chapter]({{<ref "05-uml">}}).  This should be added to a _documentation_ folder in your project, which __must__ be added to source control.  See ({{<ref "b-git-and-github/12-adding-documentation-files">}}) for guidance on ensuring the files are correctly added.  You may include either Visio, PDF, or an image file, but including a Visio file ensures you can continue to edit your UML to keep it up-to-date with changes you will make in future milestones.

Note that WPF controls define a single class in two parts (the _.xaml_ file and the _.xaml.cs_ file).  Despite it being spread over two files, it is still a single class and should have only a single box in the UML diagram.
