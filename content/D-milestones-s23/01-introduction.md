The projects for this semester are all centered around the creation of software to support a fast-food restaurant chain, **Dino Diner**. We will be developing this program iteratively, and each week we will have a new set of features to add and turn in as a milestone. Each milestone will represent a new release in your git repository.

The milestone due dates are:
