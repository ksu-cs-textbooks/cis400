This strategy is commonly employed in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to bind controls to data objects. Both Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation employ data binding.
In WPF, the data object is essentially a normal C# object, which represents some data we want to display in a control.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/04-data-binding/02-data-binding/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
