It is this Binding object that we are defining the properties of in the XAML attribute with "{Binding}". Hence, Path is a property defined on this binding.
As we mentioned before, bindings can be OneWay or TwoWay based on the direction the data flows.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/04-data-binding/03-the-binding-class/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
