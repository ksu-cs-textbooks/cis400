Moreover, we discussed how WPF uses this tree to perform its layout and rendering calculations. We also saw how we can traverse this tree in our programs to find parent or child elements of a specific type.
In addition, we saw how declaring resources at a specific point in the tree makes them available to all elements descended from that node.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/02-element-tree/07-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
