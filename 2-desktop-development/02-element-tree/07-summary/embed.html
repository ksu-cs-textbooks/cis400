The resources we looked at included <code>&lt;Style></code> elements, which allow us to declare setters for properties of a specific type of element, to apply consistent styling rules.</p><p>We also saw how we could declare resources with a <code>x:Key</code> property, and bind them as static resources to use in our controls - including strings and other common types. Building on that idea, we saw how we could embed images and other media files as resources.</p><p>We also explored how <code>&lt;ControlTemplates></code> are used to compose complex controls from simpler controls, and make it possible to swap out that implementation for a custom one. We also briefly discussed when it may make more sense to compose the <em>content</em> of a control differently to get the same effect.</p><p>When we explore events and data binding in later chapters, we will see how these concepts <em>also</em> interact with the element tree in novel ways.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1724857964 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1724857964 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1724857964 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1724857964 defer></script></body></html>
