We also explored the process of writing a test plan, a step-by-step process for a human tester to follow to provide rigor in the testing process.
We also explored the Model View ViewModel architecture in more depth, especially how it can allow us to move complex logic out of our GUI into a simple class that can be unit tested.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/06-testing-wpf/05-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
