Unfortunately this is not the case. Remember, the C# language is compiled into intermediate language to run on the .NET Runtime, and this Runtime proceeded C# (it is also used to compile Visual Basic), and the way events are implemented in intermediate language does not lend itself to inheritance patterns.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/03-events/07-inheritance-and-events/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
