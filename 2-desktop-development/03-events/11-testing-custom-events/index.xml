However, this approach does not work with non-generic events, like PropertyChanged and CollectionChanged. That is why XUnit provides an Assert.PropertyChanged() method. Unfortunately, it does not offer a corresponding test for CollectionChanged. So to test for this expectation we will need to write our own assertions.
To do that, we need to understand how assertions in the XUnit framework work.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/03-events/11-testing-custom-events/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
