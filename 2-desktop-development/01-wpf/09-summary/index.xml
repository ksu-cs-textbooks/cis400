We explored how WPF uses XAML to define partial classes, allowing for a graphical design editor with regular C# codebehind. We explored XAML syntax and many of the controls found in WPF. We also compared WPF with Windows Forms, which you have previously explored in prior classes. Finally, we discussed an approach to developing GUIs, Component-Based Design, which applies the Single Responsibility Principle to controls, and builds more complex controls through composition of these simpler controls.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/2-desktop-development/01-wpf/09-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
