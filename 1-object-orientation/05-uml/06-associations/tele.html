We break these into two further categories, based on the strength of the association, which is either <strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak</strong>. These associations are:</p><table><tr><th>Association Name</th><th>Association Type</th></tr><tr><td>Realization</td><td>weak is-a</td></tr><tr><td>Generalization</td><td>strong is-a</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregation</td><td>weak has-a</td></tr><tr><td>Composition</td><td>strong has-a</td></tr></table><h2 id=is-a-associations>Is-A Associations</h2><p>Is-a associations indicate a relationship where one class <strong>is a</strong> instance of another class. Thus, these associations represent <em>polymorphism</em>, where a class can be treated as another class, i.e. it has both its own, and the associated classes&rsquo; <em>types</em>.</p><h3 id=realization-weak-is-a>Realization (Weak is-a)</h3><p>Realization refers to making an interface &ldquo;real&rdquo; by implementing the methods it defines. For C#, this corresponds to a class that is implementing an <code>Interface</code>. We call this a <strong>is-a</strong> relationship, because the class is treated as being the type of the <code>Interface</code>. It is also a <strong>weak</strong> relationship as the same interface can be implemented by otherwise unrelated classes. In UML, realization is indicated by a dashed arrow in the direction of implementation:</p><p><a href=#R-image-aa157633b7305a6eabc4ed7409bd707f class=lightbox-link><img alt="Realization in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.2.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

For C# this corresponds to <em>inheritance</em>. We call this a <strong>strong is-a</strong> relationship, because the class has all the same state and behavior as the base class. In UML, generalization is indicated by a solid arrow in the direction of inheritance:</p><p><a href=#R-image-995bbd5bfa2b90350c6db9dcb370b298 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Generalization in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.3.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In C#, this corresponds to having a variable or collection with the type of the associated class. This is true for both kinds of has-a associations. The difference between the two is how strong the association is.</p><h3 id=aggregation>Aggregation</h3><p>Aggregation refers to collecting references to other classes. As the aggregating class has references to the other classes, we call this a <strong>has-a</strong> relationship. It is considered <strong>weak</strong> because the aggregated classes are only collected by the aggregating class, and can exist on their own. It is indicated in UML by a solid line from the aggregating class to the one it aggregates, with an open diamond &ldquo;fletching&rdquo; on the opposite side of the arrow (the arrowhead is optional).</p><p><a href=#R-image-a508711e2427cc3c3032af50f6fc7f8e class=lightbox-link><img alt="Aggregation in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.4.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

As the composed class has references to the other classes, we call this a <strong>has-a</strong> relationship. However, the composing class typically <em>creates</em> the instances of the classes composing it, and they are likewise destroyed when the composing class is destroyed. For this reason, we call it a <strong>strong</strong> relationship. It is indicated in UML by a solid line from the composing class to those it is composed of, with a solid diamond &ldquo;fletching&rdquo; on the opposite side of the arrow (the arrowhead is optional).</p><p><a href=#R-image-9f7fa890f3c0f45dfd5a03e8c82e0b82 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Composition in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.5.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

An analogy I like to use to help students reason about the difference is this:</p><p>Aggregation is like a shopping cart. When you go shopping, you place groceries into the shopping cart, and it holds them as you push it around the store. Thus, a <code>ShoppingCart</code> class might have a <code>List&lt;Grocery></code> named <code>Contents</code>, and you would add the items to it. When you reach the checkout, you would then take the items back out. The individual <code>Grocery</code> objects existed <em>before</em> they were aggregated by the <code>ShoppingCart</code>, and also <em>after</em> they were removed from it.</p><p>In contrast, Composition is like an organism. Say we create a class representing a <code>Dog</code>. It might be composed of classes like <code>Tongue</code>, <code>Ear</code>, <code>Leg</code>, and <code>Tail</code>. We would probably construct these in the <code>Dog</code> class&rsquo;s constructor, and when we dispose of the <code>Dog</code> object, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect these component classes to stick around.</p></div></div><h2 id=multiplicity>Multiplicity</h2><p>With aggregation and composition, we may also place numbers on either end of the association, indicating the number of objects involved. We call these numbers the <em>multiplicity</em> of the association.</p><p><a href=#R-image-bad7545f75dd2cbb60f228a512458d8b class=lightbox-link><img alt="Composition in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.5.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The tongue has a <code>1</code> to <code>1</code> multiplicity as each frog has one tongue.</p><p><a href=#R-image-490e0043c0f5d96a24e1ae03e0be5e98 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Aggregation in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/5.6.4.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

We see this in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> example above, where the count of <code>GroceryItems</code> in the cart ranges from 0 to infinity (infinity is indicated by an asterisk <code>*</code>).</p><p>Generalization and realization are always one-to-one multiplicities, so multiplicities are typically omitted for these associations.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1733760451 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1733760451 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1733760451 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1733760451 defer></script></body></html>
