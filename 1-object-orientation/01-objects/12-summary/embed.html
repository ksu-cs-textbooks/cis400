We discussed several different ways of looking at and reasoning about objects - as a state machine, and as structured data stored in memory. We saw how the constructor creates the memory to hold the object state and initializes its values. We saw how access modifiers and accessor methods can be used to limit and control access to the internal state of an object through message passing.</p><p>Finally, we explored how all of these concepts are implemented in the C# language.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1733760441 defer></script></body></html>
