The GOTO came to be considered too primitive, and too easy for a programmer to misuse 1.
While the GOTO statement is absent from most modern programming languages the actual functionality remains, abstracted into control-flow structures like conditionals, loops, and switch statements.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/00-introduction/05-structured-programming/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
