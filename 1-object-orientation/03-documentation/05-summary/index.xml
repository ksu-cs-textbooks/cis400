We also examined some formats this documentation can be presented in: HTML, Markdown, and XML. We also discussed autodocumentation tools, which generate developer documentation from specially-formatted comments in our code files.
We examined the C# approach to autodocumentation, using Microsoftâ€™s XML code comments formatting strategy. We explored how this data is used by Visual Studio to power its Intellisense features, and provide useful information to programmers as they work with constructs like classes, properties, and methods.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/03-documentation/05-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
