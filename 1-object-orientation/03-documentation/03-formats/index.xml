Ideally, we want code to be formatted in a way that preserves indentation. We also donâ€™t want code snippets to be subject to spelling- and grammar-checks, especially auto-correct versions of these algorithms, as they will alter the snippets. Ideally, we might also apply syntax highlighting to these snippets.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/03-documentation/03-formats/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
