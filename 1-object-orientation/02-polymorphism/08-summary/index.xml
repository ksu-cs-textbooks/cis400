We saw how in a statically-typed language (like C#), variables are not allowed to change types (though they can do so in a dynamically-typed language). We also discussed how casting can convert a value stored in a variable into a different type. Implicit casts can happen automatically, but explicit casts must be indicated by the programmer using a cast operator, as the cast could result in loss of precision or the throwing of an exception.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/02-polymorphism/08-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
