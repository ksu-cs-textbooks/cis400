We can access this from the &ldquo;Test&rdquo; menu, where we select the &ldquo;Analyze Code Coverage for All Tests&rdquo;.</p><p><a href=#R-image-469d18f54283c15958a2f64671d33c00 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Code coverage command in the Test Menu" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/1.4.7.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The results appear in the Code Coverage Results panel:</p><p><a href=#R-image-495386f4e33a6ab74016dba5783ccac0 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Code Coverage results panel" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/1.4.7.2.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

It is easily possible for you to have all of your code covered by tests, but still miss errors. You need to carefully consider the edge cases - those unexpected and unanticipated ways your code might end up being used.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1724347196 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1724347196 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1724347196 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1724347196 defer></script></body></html>
