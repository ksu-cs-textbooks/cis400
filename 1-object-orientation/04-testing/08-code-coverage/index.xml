It is a useful metric for evaluating the depth of your test, if not necessarily the quality. Basically, if your code is not executed in the test framework, it is not tested in any way. If it is executed, then at least some tests are looking at it. So aiming for a high code coverage is a good starting point for writing tests.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/04-testing/08-code-coverage/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
