Much as a compiler is a program that translates a program from a higher-order language into a lower-level form, a test program executes a test plan against the program being tested. And much like you must supply the program to be compiled, for automated testing you must supply the tests that need to be executed. In many ways the process of writing automated tests is like writing a manual test plan - you are writing instructions of what to try, and what the results should be.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/04-testing/03-automated-testing/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
