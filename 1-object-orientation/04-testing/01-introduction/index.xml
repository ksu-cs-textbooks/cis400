We mentioned earlier that it is possible to logically prove that software works by constructing a state transition table for the program, but once a program reaches a certain size this strategy becomes less feasible. Similarly, it is possible to model a program mathematically and construct a theorem that proves it will perform as intended. But in practice, most software is validated through some form of testing.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/04-testing/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
