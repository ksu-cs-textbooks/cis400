It might have properties for four burners, which correspond to what heat output they are currently set to. Let&rsquo;s assume this is as an integer between 0 (off) and 5 (high).

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we&rsquo;ve written the test using the C# <a href=https://xunit.net/ rel=external target=_blank>xUnit</a> test framework, which is being adopted by Microsoft as their preferred framework, replacing the <a href=https://nunit.org/ rel=external target=_blank>nUnit</a> test framework (there are many other C# test frameworks, but these two are the most used).</p><p>Notice that the test is simply a method, defined in a class. This is very common for test frameworks, which tend to be written using the same programming language the programs they test are written in (which makes it easier for one programmer to write both the code unit and the code to test it). Above the class appears an <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/ rel=external target=_blank>attribute</a> - <code>[Fact]</code>. Attributes are a way of supplying metadata within C# code. This metadata can be used by the compiler and other programs to determine how it works with your code. In this case, it indicates to the xUnit test runner that this method is a test.</p><p>Inside the method, we create an instance of stove, and then use the <code>Assert.Equal&lt;T>(T expected, T actual)</code> method to determine that the actual and expected values match. If they do, the assertion is marked as passing, and the test runner will display this pass. If it fails, the test runner will report the failure, along with details to help find and fix the problem (what value was expected, what it actually was, and which test contained the assertion).</p><p>The xUnit framework provides for two kinds of tests, <em>Facts</em>, which are written as functions that have no parameters, and <em>Theories</em>, which do have parameters. The values for these parameters are supplied with another attribute, typically <code>[InlineData]</code>. For example, we might test that when we set a burner to a setting within the valid 0-5 range, it is set to that value:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=na>[Theory]</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The values in the parentheses of the <code>InlineData</code> are the values supplied to the parameter list of the theory method. Thus, this test is actually <em>six</em> tests; each test makes sure that one of the settings is working. We could have done all six as separate assignments and assertions within a single fact, but using a theory means that if only one of these settings doesn&rsquo;t work, we will see that one test fail while the others pass. This level of specificity can be very helpful in finding errors.</p><p>So far our tests cover the expected behavior of our stove. But where tests really prove their worth is with the <em>edge cases</em> - those things we as programmers don&rsquo;t anticipate. For example, what happens if we try setting our range to a setting above 5? Should it simply clamp at 5? Should it not change from its current setting? Or should it shut itself off entirely because its user is clearly a pyromaniac bent on burning down their house? If the specification for our program doesn&rsquo;t say, it is up to us to decide. Let&rsquo;s say we expect it to be clamped at 5:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=na>[Theory]</span>

Also, now that we have defined our expected behavior, we should make sure the documentation of our BurnerOne property matches it:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cs>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cs>/// &lt;/value&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cs>/// &lt;remarks&gt;</span>

We&rsquo;d also want to test the other edge cases: i.e. when the burner is set to a negative number.</p><div class="box notices cstyle warning"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div><div class=box-content><p>Recognizing and testing for edge cases is a critical aspect of test writing. But it is also a difficult skill to develop, as we have a tendency to focus on expected values and expected use-cases for our software. But most serious errors occur when values outside these expectations are introduced. Also, remember special values, like <code>double.PositiveInfinity</code>, <code>double.NegativeInfinity</code>, and <code>double.NaN</code>.</p></div></div><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1733760441 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1733760441 defer></script></body></html>
