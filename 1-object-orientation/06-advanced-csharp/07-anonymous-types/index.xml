These are read-only objects whose type is created by the compiler rather than being defined in code. They are created using syntax very similar to object initializer syntax.
For example, the line:
var name = new { First="Jack", Last="Sprat" };Creates an anonymous object with properties First and Last and assigns it to the variable name. Note we have to use var, because the object does not have a defined type.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/06-advanced-csharp/07-anonymous-types/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
