This is why reference types can be null - this indicates they arenâ€™t pointing at anything. In contrast, value types cannot be null - they always contain a value. However, there are times it would be convenient to have a value type be allowed to be null.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/06-advanced-csharp/06-nullables/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
