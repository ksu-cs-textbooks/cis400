Before we close this section though, it would be a good idea to recognize that C# is not just an object-oriented language, but actually draws upon many ideas and syntax approaches that are not very object-oriented at all!
In this chapter, we’ll examine many aspects of C# that fall outside of the object-oriented mold.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/06-advanced-csharp/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
