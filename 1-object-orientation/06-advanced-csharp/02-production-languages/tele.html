To support this goal, the developers of the C# language have made many efforts to make C# code easier to write, read, and reason about. Each new version of C# has added additional syntax and features to make the language more powerful and easier to use. In some cases, these are entirely new things the language couldn&rsquo;t do previously, and in others they are <em>syntactic sugar</em> - a kind of abbreviation of an existing syntax. Consider the following <code>if</code> statement:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>if</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>someTestFlag</span><span class=p>)</span> 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>{</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=n>DoThing</span><span class=p>();</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>else</span> 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>{</span> 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=n>DoOtherThing</span><span class=p>();</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As the branches only execute a single expression each, this can be abbreviated as:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>if</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>someTestFlag</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=n>DoThing</span><span class=p>();</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>else</span> <span class=n>DoOtherThing</span><span class=p>();</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly, Visual Studio has evolved side-by-side with the language. For example, you have probably come to like <em>Intellisense</em> - Visual Studio&rsquo;s ability to offer descriptions of classes and methods as you type them, as well as <em>code completion</em>, where it offers to complete the statement you have been typing with a likely target. As we mentioned in our section on learning programming, these powerful features can be great for a professional, but can interfere with a novice programmer&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the features of C# that we haven&rsquo;t examined in detail yet.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1728334438 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1728334438 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1728334438 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1728334438 defer></script></body></html>
