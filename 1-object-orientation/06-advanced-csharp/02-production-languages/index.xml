To support this goal, the developers of the C# language have made many efforts to make C# code easier to write, read, and reason about. Each new version of C# has added additional syntax and features to make the language more powerful and easier to use. In some cases, these are entirely new things the language couldnâ€™t do previously, and in others they are syntactic sugar - a kind of abbreviation of an existing syntax.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/06-advanced-csharp/02-production-languages/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
