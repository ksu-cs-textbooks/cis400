This technology integrates querying directly into the C# language. It can act as a bridge to a MS SQL server, replacing the need for writing SQL queries and processing the results. But it can also be used to query collections that implement the IEnumerable interface, as well as XML files. As such, we can design the logic of our program to use LINQ, and change out the data source for any of these options with minimal refactoring.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/05-linq/03-linq/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
