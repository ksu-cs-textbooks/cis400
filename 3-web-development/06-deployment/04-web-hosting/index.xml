A computer connected to the Internet A web server program listening at port 80 and/or 433 (depending on if you are using secure communications) If you are using secure communications, a security certificate issued by a valid authority. Let’s Encrypt offers free certificates, and is a good source for starting web developers A domain name (while this is technically optional, if you expect users to visit your website you’ll probably need one) While you have been running your website in debug mode on your development computer, you probably won’t use it to host your actual website on the Internet.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/06-deployment/04-web-hosting/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
