For this request to be sent to the right server, we must first determine the serverâ€™s address. This address takes the form of an Internet Protocol (IP) address. There are currently two ways these IP addresses are specified, IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits split into 8 bit chunks, and is typically expressed as four integers between 0 and 255 separated by periods.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/06-deployment/02-web-addresses/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
