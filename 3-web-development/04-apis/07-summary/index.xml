We saw how to use the WebRequest object to make this task approachable. We also revisited ideas youâ€™ve seen in prior courses like the IDisposable interface and using statements to work with unmanaged objects. We saw how to consume XML data we receive as a response from a web API.
We also discussed using async methods to allow our programs to continue to respond to user input and incoming web requests while processing long-running tasks in parallel.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/04-apis/07-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
