First you must establish a connection with the server, then create the request data, then you must stream that data to your server through the connection. Once the server has received and processed your request data, it should stream a response back to you.
You can write code to handle each step, but most programming languages provide one or more libraries that provide a level of abstraction to this process.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/04-apis/02-making-requests/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
