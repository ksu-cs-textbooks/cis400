using Stream responseStream = response.GetStream() { // TODO: Use the responseStream }Let’s examine this statement in more detail. This use of using is a using statement, not to be confused with a using directive.
When you put a statement like using System.Text, you are using the using directive, which instructs the compiler to use types in the corresponding namespace without needing to provide the fully qualified namespace.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/3-web-development/04-apis/03-working-with-disposables/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
