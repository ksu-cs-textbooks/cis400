Fox) travels back in time to save his scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Loyd). An advance warning: Many of my pop-culture references are going to be grounded in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. You may be more familiar with the animated show &ldquo;Rick and Morty,&rdquo; which was inspired by Doc and Marty&rsquo;s relationship in the film.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1731961659 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1731961659 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1731961659 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1731961659 defer></script></body></html>
