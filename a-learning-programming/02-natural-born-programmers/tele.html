This is a dangerous idea, because of its corollary - the idea that &ldquo;some people simply aren&rsquo;t able to learn programming.&rdquo; If you embrace these related ideas, you will find yourself wondering to which set you actually belong.</p><p>The truth is that in learning to <em>program</em>, we are learning to solve problems <em>in a way that can be performed by a computing machine</em>. Think back to your introductory computer science course - you may have been asked to give instructions to the professor or a peer to perform a task. Shuffling cards, for example, or making a peanut butter sandwich, as in the following video from the Darnit family:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FN2RM-CHkuI frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The point of this exercise is to understand the <em>exactitude</em> or <em>precision</em> with which programs must be written. But it also reveals just how different people are from computers. The simple truth is that to become good programmers, we must <em>learn</em> to write programs by developing an understanding of how the computers work, as well as how to express instructions in a form they can use.</p><p>The rest of this chapter is devoted to understanding that learning process.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1737134607 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1737134607 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1737134607 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1737134607 defer></script></body></html>
