When set up correctly, this tool will automatically evaluate your milestones and provide feedback on where your submission does not yet meet the specification.
For this tool to provide you with feedback, you must meet two conditions:
You must set up webhooks within your GitHub repository, and You must use feature branches for each new milestone, and push these branches to your GitHub repository The first milestone will walk you through the steps to meet condition 1.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/d-milestones-f21/02-feature-branches/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
