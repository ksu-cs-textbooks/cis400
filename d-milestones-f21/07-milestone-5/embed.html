These are created by extending the <code>UserControl</code> class found in WPF, and embedding controls into other controls, either by nesting them within XAML, or by adding them programmatically. The goal is to create a complete user interface for the Point of Sale system. The initial screen might look something like:</p><p><a href=#R-image-4e82c56d53c562178ed2edcb9c83dcf0 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example POS Main Screen" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.f21.7.6.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The &ldquo;Select Items&rdquo; button in this screen will then return back to the menu item selection screen.</p><p>In this arrangement, we see three components (The <code>MainWindow</code> which is <em>composed</em> of the other controls and manages the overall layout, an <code>OrderSummaryControl</code> that displays the order details, and either the <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>, or an item customization control for a specific menu item):</p><p><a href=#R-image-cb668f3fc7d81ab74709cc865bf6506e class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.f21.7.8.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-cb668f3fc7d81ab74709cc865bf6506e><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.f21.7.8.png></a></p><p>Making the <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> and the customization screens children (i.e. a composition association) of the <code>MainWindow</code> greatly simplifies managing the swapping between the various screens as changes are being made to the order - though this is certainly not the only way of setting up the application.</p><h4 id=mainwindow>MainWindow</h4><p>Every WPF application has a class that extends the <code>MainWindow</code> control. This serves as the topmost control and contains the other controls/components of the program, as well as managing windows operations (going fullscreen, closing, etc). Some of the logic of the application can be placed into this class as well, though in many cases it makes more sense to place this in a component that is the child of the <code>MainWindow</code>.</p><p>The <code>MainWindow</code> component also defines the default size of the application. In our case, your application should be targeting a touch screen interface with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, so you should set the <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> attributes of your <code>&lt;MainWindow></code> accordingly. It should also be composed of (contain) a <code>&lt;OrderSummaryControl></code> and a <code>&lt;MenuSelectionControl></code> instance (the requirements for these components appear below), and you will determine how large these components will be displayed based on how you position them within the <code>MainWindow</code>.</p><div class="box notices cstyle hint"><div class=box-label></div><div class=box-content><p>You may notice that most controls have a <code>DesignWidth</code> and <code>DesignHeight</code> attribute - this determines the size the control is shown <em>in Visual Studio&rsquo;s GUI Designer</em>. This does <strong>not</strong> reflect the actual size that will be used when the program is run (that is calculated based on the size of the container). It is a good idea to change these attributes to match the <em>expected</em> size of your control when displayed.</p></div></div><p>Additionally, the <code>MainWindow</code> should have buttons for &ldquo;Cancel Order&rdquo;, &ldquo;Complete Order&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Select Items&rdquo;. We will add the functionality for these buttons in the next milestone.</p><h4 id=order-summary-control>Order Summary Control</h4><p>Define a custom component <code>OrderSummaryControl</code> in the files <em>OrderSummaryControl.xaml</em> and <em>OrderSummaryControl.xaml.cs</em>. This component will be used to display the order details - the order number, date, price, tax, and total, as well as all the items in the order and their details. You should create placeholders for all of this information using the standard WPF components, i.e. <code>&lt;TextField></code> and <code>&lt;ListView></code>, and organize them using one of the layout strategies you have learned.</p><p>We will bind these controls to real order data in the next milestone.</p><h4 id=menu-item-selection-control>Menu Item Selection Control</h4><p>Define a custom component <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> in the files <em>MenuSelectionControl.xaml</em> and <em>MenuSelectionControl.xaml.cs</em>. This component will be used to display buttons corresponding to each menu item, allowing it to be added to the order being taken at the moment (we will implement the actual functionality in the next milestone).</p><p>You can arrange these buttons in any fashion you like, but be mindful of your end-users. You should try to achieve a design that is intuitive to the average user. Also as you design this control, keep in mind <em>usability</em> and the cashiers who will be using it. For some cashiers, small buttons may be difficult to touch due to advanced age, neuromuscular conditions, or simply large fingertips, so making your buttons large and easy to distinguish is a good idea. Similarly, some cashiers my have various vision issues, so making text large and easy-to-read is a good idea. Finally, some cashiers may be illiterate, so pictures of the menu item are often included as well.</p><p>The <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> must allow for the selection of each menu item currently offered by GyroScope:</p><p><em>Entrees</em></p><ul><li>Virgo Classic Gyro</li><li>Scorpio Spicy Gyro</li><li>Leo Lamb Gyro</li><li>Pisces Fish Dish</li></ul><p><em>Sides</em></p><ul><li>Taurus Tabouleh</li><li>Gemini Stuffed Grape Leaves</li><li>Sagittarius Greek Salad</li><li>Aries Fries</li></ul><p><em>Drinks</em></p><ul><li>Libra Libation</li><li>Capricorn Mountain Tea</li></ul><p><em>Treats</em></p><ul><li>Aquarius Ice</li><li>Cancer Halva Cake</li></ul><p>Remember also that your <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>&rsquo;s size is determined by the amount of space you have allocated for it in the <code>MainWindow</code>. You should use this size as your <code>DesignWidth</code> and <code>DesignHeight</code> to ensure the control is completely visible in the final program.</p><h4 id=item-customization-controls>Item Customization Controls</h4><p>For each menu item, you will need to allow the cashier to customize it to meet the customer&rsquo;s requests. You will probably want to accomplish this with a custom control for each type of menu item (though you may be able to combine multiple types under a single customization control).</p><p>This means that for each boolean property in the menu item, the cashier should be able to change the boolean to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> easily. Checkboxes, toggle buttons, and switches are all common methods for representing this kind of functionality in a GUI. Similarly, controls for changing categorical information (i.e. the enumeration types for size and flavor) need to be supplied for those items that use them. Commonly used approaches for this include drop-down selection menus and radio buttons. As with the menu selection screen, these should be large enough to be easily interacted with, and clearly denote what they change (Note these do not yet need to be functional - that will be the focus of the next milestone).</p><div class="box notices cstyle info"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div><div class=box-content><p>Because we are giving you flexibility in how to define the item customization control classes, Pendant cannot account for all the possibilities. Accordingly, Pendant will <em>not</em> notify you if you have not created all the customization classes you need, or provided the requisite controls to customize them. It is your responsibility to ensure you have adequate controls.</p></div></div><h4 id=update-your-umls>Update your UMLs</h4><p>Once you&rsquo;ve created your new controls and all the classes involved, remember to add them to your UML diagram for the <code>PointOfSale</code> project. This can either be a new UML diagram, or you can create another namespace in your existing UML diagram.</p><p>You might wonder how to represent WPF controls in UML given that there are two files associated with each control: a <em>.xaml</em> and a <em>.xaml.cs</em>. While there are <em>two</em> files, they represent a <em>single</em> class (remember, WPF uses the <code>partial</code> keyword to declare control classes), so there will only be a single box for each control.</p><p>Technically, any control you embed inside another control is a <em>composition</em> relationship, i.e. adding a <code>&lt;TextBox></code> to a custom control. However, in the interest of legibility of the resulting UML diagram, we will only show these relationships for custom controls defined in our project. So you will need to show the relationship between <code>MainWindow</code>, <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>, and <code>OrderSummaryControl</code>.</p><p>Also, if you made any modifications to the data project, remember to update its UML diagram as well. This also includes fixing any issues your grader found in your previous diagram version.</p><p><strong>Note: You do not need to create a UML diagram of your <code>DataTest</code> project, though you can if you want.</strong></p><h2 id=the-milestone-feature-branch>The Milestone Feature Branch</h2><p>You will want to <a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/d-milestones-f21/02-feature-branches/ rel=external target=_blank>create a feature branch and push it to GitHub</a> for your validations to be generated on <a href=https://pendant.cs.ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>https://pendant.cs.ksu.edu</a>.
