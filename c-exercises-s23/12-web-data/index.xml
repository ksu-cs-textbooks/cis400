Consider the example application we have been developing - it exposes a database of movie information to the user. How might a user want to use this database? They might want to find the details for a specific movie - who directed it, when was it released, etc.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:00:28 -0600</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Adding Search to the Movie Site</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/01-simple-search/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/01-simple-search/</guid><description>Let’s add a search form and functionality to our movie website. We’ll add this to our Index.cshtml page, just above the &lt;h1> element:
&lt;form> &lt;input type="text" name="SearchTerms"/> &lt;input type="submit" value="Search"> &lt;/form> &lt;h1>Movie Results&lt;/h1>We’ll also change the &lt;h1> contents to “Movie Results”.
Try typing a search term into the search box, and click the search button. Has anything changed?
The Request Object When you click the search button, the browser serializes your form, and makes a request against your server including the search terms.</description></item><item><title>Adding Categorical Filters to the Movie Site</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/02-categorical-filters-edit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/02-categorical-filters-edit/</guid><description>Let’s add some filters to the page as well. We’ll start with categorical filters, i.e. filtering by category. Let’s start by filtering for MPAA Rating. We know that there are only a handful of ratings issued by the Motion Picture Association of America - G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. We might be tempted to use an enumeration to represent these values, but in C# an enumeration cannot have strings for values.</description></item><item><title>Adding Categorical Filters to the Movie Site</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/02-categorical-filters-edit2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/02-categorical-filters-edit2/</guid><description>Let’s add some filters to the page as well.

While we could create categories and use checkboxes, this doesn’t capture the incremental values (i.e. 4.3), and it would be a lot of checkboxes for Rotten Tomatoes ratings! Instead, we’ll use a numerical filter, which limits our possible results to a range - between a minimum and maximum value.
Moreover, let’s clean up our Index page, as it is getting difficult to determine what filter(s) go together, and and are adding more.</description></item><item><title>Numerical Filters</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/03-numerical-filters-edit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/03-numerical-filters-edit/</guid><description>Let’s tackle one of the critics ratings next.

In professional practice, we would probably replace this with an external database program. These programs have been developed specifically for persisting and accessing data, and leverage specialized data structures like B+ trees that allow them to do searches and filters much more efficiently.
Some of the most widely adopted database programs are relational databases like MySQL, MsSQL, Postgres, and SQLLite.</description></item></channel></rss>
