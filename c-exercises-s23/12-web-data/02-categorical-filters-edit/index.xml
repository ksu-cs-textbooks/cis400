We’ll start with categorical filters, i.e. filtering by category. Let’s start by filtering for MPAA Rating. We know that there are only a handful of ratings issued by the Motion Picture Association of America - G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. We might be tempted to use an enumeration to represent these values, but in C# an enumeration cannot have strings for values.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/12-web-data/02-categorical-filters-edit/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
