It was used to differentiate between different kinds of devices, i.e. a computer screen, printer, etc. Only the print type saw broad adoption, but it remains useful. Let’s see how we can use it.
If we look at our Pages/Index.cshtml page, we can find an &lt;aside> element that contains a banner advertisement for Bernie’s. The &lt;aside> element is a semantic element - one that implies a specific meaning for what it contains.</description></item><item><title>Media Queries</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/02-media-queries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/02-media-queries/</guid><description>In CSS3, the @media rule was extended to include the concept of media queries, a technique that allows us to conditionally apply CSS rules using a broader range of values. Some of the most commonly used are:
The width and the height of the viewport (the area on-screen) The width and height of the device (the monitor, phone, or other screen) The orientation (landscape or portrait) The resolution Media queries are primarily used to enable responsive design, which refers to your page re-arranging itself for display on different devices.</description></item><item><title>Float-based Responsive Layout</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/04-float-based-layout/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/04-float-based-layout/</guid><description>Now that we have seen the concept of responsive breakpoints, let’s put them to use creating a layout for our web page. Currently we have three &lt;div> elements, each with a header and placeholder text. We’d like to arrange these into a row of three columns if the screen is large enough, and collapse them into a single column on smaller screens, such as a mobile phone.
We’re going to explore several strategies for accomplishing this.</description></item><item><title>Responsive Setup</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/03-responsive-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/03-responsive-setup/</guid><description>In web development, Responsive Design means making your webpages adjust to the device they are displayed on. This is especially important today, where a user might be browsing the web from a desktop, a tablet, a phone, or even a console built into a refrigerator, a car, or an airplane seat!
Before we go farther, there are a couple of concepts we need to understand. The first is the device width and device height, which are the actual size of the device’s screen.</description></item><item><title>Flex-based Responsive Layout</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/05-flex-based-layout/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/05-flex-based-layout/</guid><description>Now, the float-based layout is really a bit of a hack, as the intent of the float property is really for the embedding of images and callouts to the sides of text content. Unfortunately, floats and tables were the only mechanisms in earlier versions of CSS to allow for more nuanced layouts.
However, that has changed with CSS3, which has introduced several new layout algorithms to supplement the traditional flow and table ones.</description></item><item><title>Grid-based</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/07-grid-based/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/07-grid-based/</guid><description>TODO: float based responsive layouts</description></item><item><title>Summary</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/08-bootstrap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/c-exercises-s23/11-responsive-design/08-bootstrap/</guid><description>TODO: float based responsive layouts</description></item></channel></rss>
