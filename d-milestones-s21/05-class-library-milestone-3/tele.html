It also brings us more practice writing classes and explores some less-than object oriented aspects of C#. Note too that the specifications you are supplied with are getting less specific, and leaving more for you to interpret. This also reflects real-world practice.</p><h3 id=recommendations>Recommendations:</h3><p>Read the entire assignment before you start to code. Make sure you understand what is being asked of you. Start early, these assignments are going to start taking more and more time to complete.</p><h3 id=assignment-details>Assignment Details</h3><h2 id=enum-classes>Enum Classes</h2><p>All enums should reside in the <code>TheFlyingSaucer.Data.Enums</code> namespace</p><p>There is one additional enum needed:</p><ul><li><code>JuiceFlavor</code> - Includes the following attributes:<ul><li>Orange</li><li>Cranberry</li><li>Grape</li><li>Apple</li><li>Tomato</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=base-classes>Base Classes</h2><p>Define abstract base classes for your drinks, called <code>Drink</code>. All drinks should inherit from <code>Drink</code>. The <code>Drink</code> base classes should be defined in the <code>TheFlyingSaucer.Data.Drinks</code> namespace.</p><p>All properties that are shared by derived <code>Drink</code> classes should be pushed to the base class (generalization). Examine the drink class requirements below to determine what should be generalized.</p><h2 id=drink-classes>Drink Classes</h2><p>All drinks should reside in the <code>FlyingSaucer.Data.Drink</code> namespace.</p><p>The Flying Saucer offers three drinks:</p><ul><li><p>Liquified Vegetation</p></li><li><p>Saucer Fuel</p></li><li><p>Water</p></li></ul><p>Each drink should implement a property for: <code>Name</code> (a <code>string</code>), <code>Description</code> (a <code>string</code>), <code>Size</code> (a <code>Size</code> enumeration), <code>Price</code> (a <code>decimal</code>), <code>Calories</code> (a <code>uint</code>), and <code>SpecialInstructions</code> (a <code>List&lt;String></code>), containing any special instructions needed to prepare the dish for a specific customer (or empty if there are none).</p><hr><h4 id=liquified-vegetation-juice>Liquified Vegetation (Juice)</h4><p>Liquified Vegetation should be named <em>[Size] Liquified Vegetation</em> where <em>[Size]</em> is <em>Small</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or <em>Large</em>, and bear the description <em>Fresh juice extracted from the finest fruits and vegetables.</em> It can be small, medium, or large, and should have one of the flavors from the <code>JuiceFlavor</code> enum. Its price is $1.00 (small), $1.50 (medium), and $2.00 (large). Its calories vary according to the type of juice:</p><table><tr><th>Flavor</th><th>Calories (small)</th><th>Calories (medium)</th><th>Calories (large)</th></tr><tr><td>Orange</td><td>111</td><td>222</td><td>333</td></tr><tr><td>Cranberry</td><td>117</td><td>234</td><td>481</td></tr><tr><td>Grape</td><td>152</td><td>304</td><td>456</td></tr><tr><td>Apple</td><td>113</td><td>226</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>Tomato</td><td>42</td><td>84</td><td>126</td></tr></table><p>Its special instructions should indicate the type of juice (i.e. &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;).</p><h4 id=saucer-fuel-coffee>Saucer Fuel (Coffee)</h4><p>Saucer Fuel should be named <em>[Size] Decaf Saucer Fuel</em> when the coffee is decaffeinated, or <em>[Size] Saucer Fuel</em> for regular coffee. In both cases <em>[Size]</em> is <em>Small</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or <em>Large</em>. The description should be <em>Beamed directly from the best coffee plantations of South America, our rich brew is bound to put a bounce in your spacewalk.</em> Its price should be $1.00 (small), $1.20 (medium), or $1.40 (large). Its calories should be 1 (small), 2, (medium), or 3 (large). It should have boolean properties for <code>RoomForCream</code> (default <code>false</code>), and <code>Decaf</code> (also default <code>false</code>). Special instructions should either be empty or specify &ldquo;Room for Cream&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=water-water>Water (Water)</h4><p>Water should be named <em>[Size] Water</em> with <em>[Size]</em> being <em>Small</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or <em>Large</em>. Its description should be <em>Watch out if you come from a planet where pure H2O is deadly, because that&rsquo;s all this is!</em> Its price should be $0 regardless of size, and calories are 0 regardless of size. It should have a boolean property for <code>Ice</code> which is <code>true</code> by default. If <code>Ice</code> is <code>false</code>, then the special instructions should include &ldquo;No Ice&rdquo;, otherwise the should be empty.</p><h4 id=iorderitem-interface>IOrderItem Interface</h4><p>Create an interface named IOrderItem.cs which contains the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>Price - a getter of type <code>decimal</code></p></li><li><p>Calories - A getter of type <code>uint</code></p></li><li><p>SpecialInstructions - A getter of type <code>List&lt;string></code></p></li></ul><p>All entrees, drinks, and sides will need to implement this interface.</p><h4 id=inheritance-and-interfaces>Inheritance and Interfaces</h4><p>With your new interface and base classes, you will need to refactor your existing classes to ensure:</p><ul><li>All entrees inherit <code>Entree</code></li><li>All sides inherit <code>Side</code></li><li>All drinks inherit <code>Drink</code></li><li>All menu items (entrees, sides, and drinks) implement <code>IOrderItem</code></li></ul><h4 id=create-a-static-menu-class>Create a static Menu class</h4><p>You should also create a static class named <code>Menu</code> declared in the file <em>Menu.cs</em> which contains the following <code>static</code> properties:</p><ul><li><code>Entrees</code> which returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IOrderItem></code> containing an instance of all available entrees. For entrees with choices, i.e. egg style or syrup flavors, you only need to show the default choice. However, you should include half-stack options.</li><li><code>Sides</code> which returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IOrderItem></code> containing an instance of all available sides. As each side has 3 different sizes, this collection should contain a small, medium, and large instance of each. Again, you do not need to supply all the egg styles.</li><li><code>Drinks</code> which returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IOrderItem></code> containing all available drinks. As each drink has 3 different sizes, this collection should contain a small, medium, and large instance of each. Similarly, it should contain one of every size and flavor of <code>LiquifiedVegetation</code>, and six instances of <code>SaucerFuel</code> to represent both regular and decaf small, medium, and large.</li><li><code>FullMenu</code> should return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IOrderItem></code> containing all of the items on the menu.</li></ul><p>Note that you cannot create an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IOrderItem></code> directly - rather it is an interface that most collections implement. So use a collection of your choice that has the interface.</p><h4 id=testing>Testing</h4><p>You will need to add unit test classes for all your new drink classes. These should be named and organized much like the tests you implemented for the sides - but this time you will need to create the entire class from scratch.</p><p>You will also need to expand your tests of all menu items to ensure that they each implement the <code>IOrderItem</code> interface. This can be done with the <code>Assert.IsAssignableFrom&lt;T>(object obj)</code> assertion, which checks that <code>obj</code> can be cast to be of type <code>T</code>, i.e.:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=na>[Fact]</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>public</span> <span class=k>void</span> <span class=n>ShouldBeAssignableToAbstractFooClass</span><span class=p>()</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>{</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=kt>var</span> <span class=n>bar</span> <span class=p>=</span> <span class=k>new</span> <span class=n>bar</span><span class=p>();</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=n>Assert</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>IsAssignableFrom</span><span class=p>&lt;</span><span class=n>Foo</span><span class=p>&gt;(</span><span class=n>bar</span><span class=p>);</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Additionally, you should test that all items on the menu can be cast to their respective base classes (<code>Entree</code>, <code>Side</code>, or <code>Drink</code>). This, and the interface test, should be placed in the corresponding unit test class.</p><p>You should also test the properties in the <code>Menu</code> class to ensure they return a correct list of items. This can be done with the <code>Assert.Collection()</code> assertion or a series of <code>Assert.Contains()</code>. If you are unsure on how to do this please visit office hours for directions. Try this yourself first don’t come to us unless you have spent some time trying to figure it out. You should be able to reach 100% code coverage on the <code>Menu</code> class.</p><h4 id=update-or-create-the-uml-class-diagram>Update or Create the UML Class Diagram</h4><p>You will also need to create (or update) a UML Class Diagram to correspond to the Data project <em>as you have implemented it</em>. You may choose to use the diagram from Milestone #1 as a starting point. It is saved in Microsoft Visio format in the <em>documentation</em> folder of your project.</p><p>Microsoft Visio is available to CS students for free through the Azure Student Portal, see <a href=https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/FAQ#MSDNAA rel=external target=_blank>this support page</a> for details. It can also be found on the remote desktop machines. Alternatively, you may create your UML with a tool of your choice.</p><p>Your finished UML diagram should be included in a <em>documentation</em> folder in a format that the UTAs can access (i.e. <code>pdf</code> or <code>png</code> with the name <em>data-milestone-3-uml</em>). You may also place your source file in the project, but the image or pdf file is what will be graded. <strong>Be sure you actually include the file itself, not just a link to a location on your computer!
