A POS is the modern equivalent of a cash register, used to put together a sale, take payment, print receipts, and typically integrates with a businesses&rsquo; inventory tracking system and accounting system. In our case, we are focusing on the kind of POS found in the fast-food industry; one that takes orders, and sends an order to the kitchen, as well as taking payment and printing a receipt.</p><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p><strong>Design Contest Announcement</strong></p><p>With the Point of Sale project, we want to encourage you to go above and beyond the core requirements of the assignments, and create an application that is both attractive and easy to use. In other words, a <em>great design</em>! This will both help you develop your skills, and make a great portfolio piece when you start applying for jobs.</p><p>Accordingly, every semester we award prizes (Radina&rsquo;s Gift Cards) for the best POS design. This will be judged by your TAs, and will be decided at the last milestone in the Point of Sale project (POS #4). To be a serious contender though, you should start your efforts with this milestone.</p><p>Also, the departmental graphic designer has prepared images that may be used in your Point of Sale. You can find them on Canvas or download them <a href=/cis400/files/FlyingSaucerMenuArt.zip>here</a>.</p></div></div><h3 id=general-requirements>General requirements:</h3><ul><li><p>You will need to follow the style laid out in the C# Coding Conventions</p></li><li><p>Adding a new project named <em>PointOfSale</em></p></li><li><p>You will need to comment your code using XML comments</p></li></ul><h3 id=assignment-requirements>Assignment requirements:</h3><ul><li><p>Create a new Project of type Windows Presentation Foundation within your <em>FlyingSaucer</em> project</p></li><li><p>Create GUI components by extending the WPF <code>UserControl</code> base class to create your own custom controls consisting of layout elements and customization screens for all menu items currently offered on the menu</p></li><li><p>Provide navigation functionality to switch between selection and customization screens</p></li><li><p>Create/Update UML Class Diagrams corresponding to your projects (both the <em>Data</em> and <em>PointOfSale</em> projects).

XAML is a markup language based on XML which is used by WPF in a manner similar to how HTML defines the display of web pages. This assignment will challenge you to use a language you probably have not used before. We will focus on navigation between screens and how to connect user input with functionality.</p><h3 id=assignment-details>Assignment Details</h3><p>Most of this class is concerned with creating custom components which bundle related functionality into a single custom control. These are created by extending the <code>UserControl</code> class found in WPF, and embedding controls into other controls, either by nesting them within XAML, or by adding them programmatically. The goal is to create a complete user interface for the Point of Sale system. The initial screen might look something like:</p><p><a href=#R-image-128b5056529de6dc45a2a4ad98eff211 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example POS Main Screen" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.6.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The &ldquo;Done&rdquo; button in this screen will then return back to the main screen.</p><p>In this arrangement, we might see three components (The MainWindow, an order component that manages the overall order, and either the menu item selection screen, or a customization screen for a specific element):</p><p><a href=#R-image-c93441a7b82524490dfaf89980076dec class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.6.3.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-c93441a7b82524490dfaf89980076dec><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.6.3.png></a></p><p>Making the menu item selection screen and the customization screens children (i.e. a composition association) of the <code>OrderComponent</code> greatly simplifies managing the swapping between the various screens as changes are being made to the order - though this is certainly not the only way of setting up the application.</p><div class="box notices cstyle tip"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip</div><div class=box-content><p>Note that this example is only one possible direction for your design to go. The requirement is simply to display the order being built and provide the option to customize the menu item with its specific customizations. If you would like to organize your application differently, use different controls, add images, multimedia, animations, or use a completely different approach - you are free to do so! Doing so will make it more likely your Point of Sale will stand out from the rest of the class. Our department graphic designer has created some <a href=/cis400/files/FlyingSaucerMenuArt.zip>art resources</a> you may choose to use in your project.</p></div></div><p>Because of the flexibility offered in WPF and in this assignment, we are not requiring specific classes be written, but rather bundles of <em>functionality</em> (which you <em>will</em> probably want to collect into custom components built of classes extending the <code>UserControl</code> base class). We&rsquo;ll break down this required functionality according to these suggested components next:</p><h4 id=mainwindow>MainWindow</h4><p>While the assignment doesn&rsquo;t require specific classes, every WPF application has a class that extends the <code>MainWindow</code> control, so you will definitely have one. This serves as the topmost control and contains the other controls/components of the program, as well as managing windows operations (going fullscreen, closing, etc). Optionally, some of the logic of the application can be moved into this class as well, though in many cases it makes more sense to place this in a component that is the child of the <code>MainWindow</code>.</p><p>In addition, your MainWindow, MenuSelectionControl, or OrderComponent control should have a button or other mechanism for:</p><ol><li>Completing the order building process and starting the payment process (this does not need to be implemented yet, but your design should consider it)</li><li>Canceling the in-progress order, for those occasions where the customer changes their mind.</li></ol><p>This mechanism does not need to be functional at this point - but have a spot for it to go!</p><h4 id=order-component>Order Component</h4><p>The POS needs to manage creating and completing orders - adding items to the order, customizing those items, totaling the cost and applying tax, and collecting payment. While each of these processes will be tackled in a later milestone, it makes sense to have a single component responsible for them already in your application design. Much of these processes should be pushed into their own components (i.e. you will likely want to have a component for displaying the order information, and separate components for customizing specific menu items). Since these actions are bundled within the concept of an order, it makes sense to have one component oversee each of these subcomponents.</p><p>Remember that this component would then need to provide space for these subcomponents to be displayed, and that the order details should probably <em>always</em> be displayed throughout the order process, probably alongside other components.</p><h4 id=menu-selection-screen-component>Menu Selection Screen Component</h4><p>The POS also needs to allow the cashier to select items to add to the order. Thus, this screen will probably primarily consist of buttons to allow the user to select items from the menu. This could be handled by just one screen, or be split between multiple screens (i.e. select a menu category - entrees, sides, drinks, and then the specific items in that category). As you design this control, keep in mind <em>usability</em> and the cashiers who will be using it. For some cashiers, small buttons may be difficult to touch due to advanced age, neuro-muscular conditions, or simply large fingertips, so making your buttons large and easy to distinguish is a good idea. Similarly, some cashiers my have various vision issues, so making text large and easy-to-read is a good idea. Finally, some cashiers may be illiterate, so pictures of the menu item are often included as well.</p><p>The Menu Selection screen (or screens) must allow for the selection of each menu item currently offered by the Flying Saucer:</p><p><em>Entrees</em></p><ul><li>Flying Saucer</li><li>Crashed Saucer</li><li>The Outer Omelette</li><li>Space Scramble</li><li>Livestock Mutilation</li><li>Nothing to See Here</li></ul><p><em>Sides</em></p><ul><li>Crop Circle Oats</li><li>Glowing Haystack</li><li>Taken Bacon</li><li>Missing Links</li><li>Eviscerated Eggs</li><li>You&rsquo;re Toast!</li></ul><p><em>Drinks</em></p><ul><li>Liquified Vegetation</li><li>Saucer Fuel</li><li>Water</li></ul><h4 id=item-customization-screen-components>Item Customization Screen Components</h4><p>For each menu item, you will need to allow the cashier to customize it to meet the customer&rsquo;s requests. You will probably want to accomplish this with a custom control for each type of menu item (though you may be able to combine multiple types under a single customization screen).</p><p>This means that for each boolean property in the menu item, the cashier should be able to change the boolean to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> easily. Checkboxes, toggle buttons, and switches are all common methods for representing this kind of functionality in a GUI. Similarly, controls for changing categorical information (i.e. size, flavor) need to be supplied for those items that use them. Commonly used approaches for this include drop-down selection menus and radio buttons. As with the menu selection screen, these should be large enough to be easily interacted with, and clearly denote what they change (Note these do not yet need to be functional - that will be the focus of the next milestone).</p><p>You will also need to provide a button or other means to return to the menu item selection screen once the customization is finished.</p><h4 id=menucustomization-screen-navigation>Menu/Customization Screen Navigation</h4><p>For each button in your Menu Selection Screen, pressing that button should display the corresponding customization screen. From the customization screen, clicking the &ldquo;done&rdquo; button should display the menu selection screen. Further, this should be done without creating a memory leak (i.e. creating new screens and adding them to the elements tree as children of existing elements). The diagram below shows both desirable and undesirable element tree shapes as the user navigates the system:</p><p><a href=#R-image-0cc70b859ff279e98dd4ca159bed4cd7 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Good and Bad Elements Tree Shapes From Navigation" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.6.4.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-0cc70b859ff279e98dd4ca159bed4cd7><img alt="Good and Bad Elements Tree Shapes From Navigation" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.6.4.png></a></p><p>Note that you can still create new screens each navigation event and rely on the garbage collector to clean them up - you just need to ensure that references are no longer held for them (in which case you have a memory leak). Or you can re-use screens you&rsquo;ve already created. Either approach will result in reasonable results.</p><h4 id=update-your-umls>Update your UMLs</h4><p>Once you&rsquo;ve created your new controls and all the classes involved, remember to add them to your UML diagram for the PointOfSale project. This can either be a new UML diagram, or you can create another namespace in your existing UML diagram.</p><p>Also, if you made any modifications to the data project, remember to update its UML diagram as well. This also includes fixing any issues your grader found in your previous diagram version.</p><h4 id=point-of-sale-milestone-1-rubric>Point of Sale Milestone 1 Rubric</h4><p>Every assignment begins with 100 points, from which points are deducted using the following rubric.
