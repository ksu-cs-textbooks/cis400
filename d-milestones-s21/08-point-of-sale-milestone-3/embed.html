You will need to create public <code>Add(IOrderItem item)</code> and <code>Remove(IOrderItem item)</code> methods, which add or remove <code>IOrderItems</code> respectively. Additionally, you should implement a getter and setter for <code>SalesTaxRate</code> (a double, default 0.12) and getter-only properties for <code>Subtotal</code> (a decimal), <code>Tax</code> (a decimal), and <code>Total</code> (a decimal). The <code>Subtotal</code> is the total price for all items in the order, the <code>Tax</code> is the <code>Subtotal</code> multiplied by the <code>SalesTaxRate</code>, and <code>Total</code> is the sum of the <code>Subtotal</code> and <code>Tax</code>. It should also provide a property <code>Calories</code> which is a unsigned integer, and the sum of all the calories of the item sin the order.</p><p>Additionally, the <code>Order</code> should have an identifying <code>Number</code> getter property, which is unique to each order. An easy way to ensure uniqueness is to have a private static field, i.e. <code>nextOrderNumber</code>, which is initialized to 1. In the <code>Order</code> constructor, set this order&rsquo;s <code>Number</code> property to <code>nextOrderNumber</code> and then increment <code>nextOrderNumber</code>. When your next order is created, it will use the incremented value, and increment it again. Technically this only ensures a single Point of Sale terminal is using unique order numbers (as multiple terminals will have duplicate values), but it is sufficient for now.</p><p>Also, the <code>Order</code> should have a <code>DateTime</code> property <code>PlacedAt</code> identifying the date and time the order was placed.</p><p>Finally, this class should implement the <code>ICollection</code>, <code>INotifyCollectionChanged</code>, and <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interfaces. Each of these requires you to add specific properties and methods to the <code>Order</code> class. This also means triggering a host of events when specific actions are taken, i.e.:</p><ul><li>Adding an <code>IOrderItem</code> to the <code>Order</code> should trigger:<ol><li>A <code>CollectionChanged</code> event noting the addition of a new item</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Subtotal</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Tax</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Total</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Calories</code> property has changed</li></ol></li><li>Removing an <code>IOrderItem</code> from the <code>Order</code> should trigger:<ol><li>A <code>CollectionChanged</code> event noting the removal of the item</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Subtotal</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Tax</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Total</code> property has changed</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event noting the <code>Calories</code> property has changed</li></ol></li><li>Changing an item already in the order should trigger:<ol><li><code>PropertyChanged</code> events for <code>Subtotal</code>, <code>Tax</code>, and <code>Total</code> when the item&rsquo;s <code>Price</code> changes</li><li>A <code>PropertyChanged</code> event for <code>Calories</code> when the item&rsquo;s <code>Calories</code> changes</li></ol></li></ul><p>You may either write your collection class from scratch, or inherit from one of the existing collections and provide the extra functionality (such as <code>ObservableCollection</code>).</p><h4 id=order-unit-tests>Order Unit Tests</h4><p>Additionally, you should write unit tests to verify all of the expected functionality:</p><ul><li>Adding an item to the <code>Order</code> results in that item being included in the order</li><li>Removing an item from the <code>Order</code> results in that item being removed from the order</li><li>The order implements the <code>INotifyCollectionChanged</code> and <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interfaces</li><li>That adding an an item triggers a <code>CollectionChanged</code> event</li><li>That removing an item triggers a <code>CollectionChanged</code> event</li><li>That
, and that each of the <code>CollectionChanged</code> and <code>PropertyChanged</code> events described above occur in the described circumstances.</li></ul><h4 id=integrate-the-order-into-the-point-of-sale-project>Integrate the Order into the Point of Sale Project</h4><p>The Point of Sale GUI&rsquo;s primary role is to build <code>Order</code> objects to match the customers&rsquo; requests. Thus, you will want to integrate your new <code>Order</code> class into the GUI to provide this functionality. The easiest way to accomplish this is to set your <code>Order</code> as the <code>DataContext</code> of one of your WPF elements - ideally towards the top of the tree. Then, all of the descendant elements will <em>also</em> have it as their <code>DataContext</code>.</p><p>You should replace this <code>Order</code> object any time the &ldquo;New Order&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cancel Order&rdquo; button (depending on your implementation) are clicked.</p><p>Clicking on one of the &ldquo;Add to Order&rdquo; buttons you implemented should add an instance of the associated order item to the current <code>Order</code> object.</p><p>The contents of the current <code>Order</code> should be displayed prominently in your GUI, for example, by using a <code>&lt;ListView></code>. You will want to display:</p><ul><li>The <code>IOrderItem</code>&rsquo;s name (what you get when you invoke <code>ToString()</code> upon it)</li><li>The <code>IOrderItem</code>&rsquo;s price</li><li>The <code>IOrderItem</code>&rsquo;s special instructions</li></ul><p><em>Hint: You can add a <code>StringFormat</code> attribute to a binding to display it as currency, i.e.: <code>&lt;TextBlock Text={Binding Path=Total, StringFormat={0:c}}></code>. This approach can also be used to add bullets or extra text to a bound string before it is displayed. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.data.bindingbase.stringformat?view=net-5.0" rel=external target=_blank>the docs</a> for more details.</em></p><p>In addition, you will need to show:</p><ul><li>The <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>Number</code> property, formatted for readability, i.e. &ldquo;Order #2&rdquo;</li><li>The <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>PlacedDate</code> property, formatted for readability, i.e. &ldquo;3/20/2021 10:32 pm&rdquo;</li><li>The <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>Subtotal</code> property, formatted for readability, i.e. &ldquo;Subtotal: $10.00&rdquo;</li><li>The <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>Tax</code> property, formatted for readability, i.e. &ldquo;Tax: $1.20&rdquo;</li><li>The <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>Total</code> property, formatted for readability, i.e. &ldquo;Total: $11.20&rdquo;</li></ul><p>One possible layout appears below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-bd71252d30676433081a7d24e4f3b23c class=lightbox-link><img alt="Suggested Order control layout" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.8.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-bd71252d30676433081a7d24e4f3b23c><img alt="Suggested Order control layout" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.8.1.png></a></p><p>The displayed order should update all of this displayed information as it changes. If you use data binding for binding the <code>Order</code> properties, and have implemented the <code>CollectionChanged</code> and <code>PropertyChanged</code> events as described above, this should happen automatically, with no further code required from you.</p><p>You should also allow the user to select an item already in the order display to customize, i.e. if they have a Flying Saucer and a Eviscerated Eggs in the Order, and then need to change the syrup for the Flying Saucer, they should be able to do so. This is most easily accomplished by putting the order items in a <code>&lt;ListBox></code> and using its <code>OnSelectionChanged</code> event to swap to the customization screen. Setting the List&rsquo;s <code>IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem</code> property to true allows you to bind your customization screens to the <code>CurrentItem</code> Path of the <code>Order</code>, i.e. the item just selected in the <code>&lt;ListBox></code></p><p>Finally, you should provide a means for removing an item from the <code>Order</code>. This is most commonly accomplished by adding a button to the <code>ListBoxItem</code> data template displaying the items in the <code>&lt;ListBox></code>, so that there is a delete button for each row in the order. Another approach would be to have a single &ldquo;Remove Selected Item from Order&rdquo; which removes the item currently selected in the <code>&lt;ListBox></code>. Other approaches are possible, but should be easy for the user to intuit.</p><h4 id=writing-tests-for-your-gui>Writing Tests for your GUI</h4><p>Graphical user interfaces are notoriously difficult to test in an automated fashion. For this reason, most software developers fall back on manual testing routines. To ensure that these have the same rigor as automated tests, a <em>test plan</em> document is written that tells a tester step-by-step what they should do in the interface, and what the expected result should be.</p><p>You will need to write one for your GUI that takes the user through adding <em>each</em> menu item to the order, and changing each of hte the menu item customization options. At each step, you should call out for the user what the expected values appearing in the various GUI controls should be - especially the information in the order. The testing plan should be saved in an editable format (Word is recommended) in the documentation folder of your project, and committed to GitHub with your source files.</p><p>A second strategy for testing GUIs in WPF is the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture encouraged by WPF. In this architecture, the GUI becomes little more than a thin layer for displaying and updating data-bound values. If your control is doing significant logic, this instead is pushed to a <em>ModelView</em> class, which can be unit tested like any other. If your controls contain significant logic (i.e. calculations), you should consider refactoring to adopt this approach.</p><h4 id=update-your-uml-diagrams>Update Your UML Diagrams</h4><p>You will need to update your UML diagrams to reflect the changes you have made to the Data and Point of Sale projects. Remember to mark the associations between your <code>Order</code> and its various <code>IOrderItem</code> instances.</p><h3 id=point-of-sale-milestone-3-rubric>Point of Sale Milestone 3 Rubric</h3><p>Every assignment begins with 100 points, from which points are deducted using the following rubric.
