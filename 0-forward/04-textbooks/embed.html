For example, your CIS 300 textbook is also available there for you to go back and review. You can access any of these textbooks at the site <a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu target=_blank><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu</a></a></p><h3 id=oriley-for-higher-education>O&rsquo;Riley for Higher Education</h3><p>If you are looking for additional resources to support your learning, a great resource that is available to Kansas State University students is the <a href=https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university target=_blank>O&rsquo;Riley For Higher Education</a> digital library offered through the Kansas State University Library. These include electronic editions of thousands of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials. As of this writing, a search for object-orientation returns 13,237 results and C# returns 5,984 results. In particular, I would recommend these books:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-object-oriented-thought/9780135182130/ rel=external target=_blank>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</a>&rdquo; by Matt Weisfeld for learning more about object-orientation.</li><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-windows-presentation/9781838643416/ rel=external target=_blank>Mastering Windows Presentation Foundation</a>&rdquo; by Sheridan Yuen for learning about WPF.</li><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/xunit-test-patterns/9780131495050/ rel=external target=_blank>xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code</a>&rdquo; by Gerard Meszaros for learning about the xUnit framework.</li></ul><p>There are likewise materials for other computer science topics you may have an interest in - it is a great resource for all your CS coursework. It costs you nothing (technically, your access was paid for by your tuition and fees), so you might as well make use of it!</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1728334420 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1728334420 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1728334420 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1728334420 defer></script></body></html>
