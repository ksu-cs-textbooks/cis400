Because our controls use <em>partial</em> classes, you need to do this in two places: <em>MainWindow.xaml.cs</em> and <em>MainWindow.xaml</em>. The first looks just like any other C# file namespace, and should be familiar. But the second (<em>MainWindow.xaml.cs</em>) is XAML, and looks a bit different:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nt>&lt;Window</span> <span class=na>x:Class=</span><span class=s>&#34;PointOfSale.MainWindow&#34;</span>

The first is in the <code>x:Class</code> property, which defines what class this XAML file is providing functionality for. You must use the <em>fully qualified class name</em>, i.e. include the namespaces. Right now it is using <code>"PointOfSale.MainWindow"</code>, but it now needs to be <code>"FriedPiper.PointOfSale.MainWindow"</code>.</p><p>Th second place is the <code>xmlns:local</code> property. This is assigning an alias of <code>local</code> to the provided namespace (xmlns stands for xml namespace), which allows us to access components we define in our project. Its value needs to likewise be updated to <code>clr-namespace:FriedPiper.PointOfSale</code>.</p><p>The <code>clr-namespace</code> here refers to a <em>common language runtime</em> namespace - essentially we are creating a bridge between our C# namespace and the XML local namespace.</p><h3 id=creating-the-gui-components>Creating the GUI Components</h3><p>Most of this assignment is concerned with creating custom components which bundle related functionality into a single custom control. These are created by extending the <code>UserControl</code> class found in WPF, and embedding controls into other controls, either by nesting them within XAML, or by adding them programmatically. The goal is to create a complete user interface for the Point of Sale system. The initial screen might look something like:</p><p><a href=#R-image-1e3d9db78b131cbc2a15778990355dcf class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example POS Main Screen" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.7.6.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-cdef12a3755e6b1fcbf4179df2129bb8><img alt="Example POS Customization Screen" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.7.7.png></a></p><p>Which displays the customization options for the selected menu item. The &ldquo;Select More Items&rdquo; button in this screen will then return back to the menu item selection screen.</p><p>In this arrangement, we see three components (The <code>MainWindow</code> which is <em>composed</em> of the other controls and manages the overall layout, an <code>OrderSummaryControl</code> that displays the order details, and either the <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>, or an item customization control for a specific menu item):</p><p><a href=#R-image-a0389aeff59ee8abf46ae63e637481bf class=lightbox-link><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.f21.7.8.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-a0389aeff59ee8abf46ae63e637481bf><img alt="Example Components of the POS" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/d.f21.7.8.png></a></p><p>Making the <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> and the customization screens children (i.e. a composition association) of the <code>MainWindow</code> greatly simplifies managing the swapping between the various screens as changes are being made to the order - though this is certainly not the only way of setting up the application.</p><h4 id=mainwindow>MainWindow</h4><p>Every WPF application has a class that extends the <code>MainWindow</code> control. This serves as the topmost control and contains the other controls/components of the program, as well as managing windows operations (going fullscreen, closing, etc). Some of the logic of the application can be placed into this class as well, though in many cases it makes more sense to place this in a component that is the child of the <code>MainWindow</code>.</p><p>The <code>MainWindow</code> component also defines the default size of the application. In our case, your application should be targeting a touch screen interface with a resolution of 1080 x 720, so you should set the <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> attributes of your <code>&lt;MainWindow></code> accordingly. It should also be composed of (contain) a <code>&lt;OrderSummaryControl></code> and a <code>&lt;MenuSelectionControl></code> instance (the requirements for these components appear below), and you will determine how large these components will be displayed based on how you position them within the <code>MainWindow</code>.</p><div class="box notices cstyle hint"><div class=box-label></div><div class=box-content><p>You may notice that most controls have a <code>DesignWidth</code> and <code>DesignHeight</code> attribute - this determines the size the control is shown <em>in Visual Studio&rsquo;s GUI Designer</em>. This does <strong>not</strong> reflect the actual size that will be used when the program is run (that is calculated based on the size of the container). It is a good idea to change these attributes to match the <em>expected</em> size of your control when displayed.</p></div></div><p>Additionally, the <code>MainWindow</code> should have buttons for &ldquo;Cancel Order&rdquo;, &ldquo;Complete Order&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Select More Items&rdquo;. Clicking the &ldquo;Select More Items&rdquo; should display the Menu Item Selection screen. We will add the functionality for the other two buttons in the next milestone.</p><h4 id=order-summary-control>Order Summary Control</h4><p>Define a custom component <code>OrderSummaryControl</code> in the files <em>OrderSummaryControl.xaml</em> and <em>OrderSummaryControl.xaml.cs</em>. This component will be used to display the order details - the order number, date, price, tax, and total, as well as all the items in the order and their details. You should create placeholders for all of this information using the standard WPF components, i.e. <code>&lt;TextBlock></code> and <code>&lt;ListView></code>, and organize them using one of the layout strategies you have learned.</p><p>We will bind these controls to real order data in the next milestone.</p><h4 id=menu-item-selection-control>Menu Item Selection Control</h4><p>Define a custom component <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> in the files <em>MenuSelectionControl.xaml</em> and <em>MenuSelectionControl.xaml.cs</em>. This component will be used to display buttons corresponding to each menu item, allowing it to be added to the order being taken at the moment (we will implement the actual functionality of adding items to an order in the next milestone).</p><p>You can arrange these buttons in any fashion you like, but be mindful of your end-users. You should try to achieve a design that is intuitive to the average user. Also as you design this control, keep in mind <em>usability</em> and the cashiers who will be using it. For some cashiers, small buttons may be difficult to touch due to advanced age, neuromuscular conditions, or simply large fingertips, so make your buttons large and easy to distinguish. Similarly, some cashiers my have various vision issues, so making text large and easy-to-read is important. Finally, some cashiers may be illiterate, so pictures of the menu item are often included as well.</p><p>The <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code> must allow for the selection of each menu item currently offered by Fried Piper:</p><p><em>Treats</em></p><ul><li>Fried Pie</li><li>Fried Ice Cream</li><li>Fried Candy Bar</li><li>Fried Twinkie</li></ul><p><em>Poppers</em></p><ul><li>Apple Fritters</li><li>Fried Bananas</li><li>Fried Cheesecake</li><li>Fried Oreos</li></ul><p><em>Platters</em></p><ul><li>Piper Platter</li><li>Popper Platter</li></ul><p>Remember also that your <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>&rsquo;s size is determined by the amount of space you have allocated for it in the <code>MainWindow</code>. You should use this size as your <code>DesignWidth</code> and <code>DesignHeight</code> to ensure the control is completely visible in the final program.</p><h4 id=item-customization-controls>Item Customization Controls</h4><p>For each menu item, you will need to allow the cashier to customize it to meet the customer&rsquo;s requests. You will probably want to accomplish this with a custom control for each type of menu item (though you may be able to combine multiple types under a single customization control).</p><p>This means that for each boolean property in the menu item, the cashier should be able to change the boolean to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> easily. Checkboxes, toggle buttons, and switches are all common methods for representing this kind of functionality in a GUI. Similarly, controls for changing categorical information (i.e. the enumeration types for size and flavor) need to be supplied for those items that use them. Commonly used approaches for this include drop-down selection menus and radio buttons. As with the menu selection screen, these should be large enough to be easily interacted with, and clearly denote what they change (Note these do not yet need to be functional - that will be the focus of the next milestone).</p><h4 id=check-for-legibility-in-other-resolutions>Check for Legibility in Other Resolutions</h4><p>WPF allows GUIs to be <em>responsive</em> to different display sizes by automatically resizing controls to match the available space. Doing so successfully requires some attention to how you lay out components, however. It is a good idea to perform a quality check by running your program and stretching/shrinking the window to see how your controls cope. If a small change in resolution makes some of your controls inaccessible, you will want to fix this.</p><div class="box notices cstyle hint"><div class=box-label></div><div class=box-content><p>Dragging components in the visual GUI editor like you did when working with Windows Forms will use the component&rsquo;s <code>Margin</code> property to absolutely position the child component in its parent. This will <strong>not</strong> work well if the window is resized, and should be avoided. Instead, edit the XAML directly and use layout controls to position your elements.</p></div></div><h4 id=update-your-umls>Update your UMLs</h4><p>Once you&rsquo;ve created your new controls and all the classes involved, remember to add them to your UML diagram for the <code>PointOfSale</code> project. This can either be a new UML diagram, or you can create another namespace in your existing UML diagram.</p><p>You might wonder how to represent WPF controls in UML given that there are two files associated with each control: a <em>.xaml</em> and a <em>.xaml.cs</em>. While there are <em>two</em> files, they represent a <em>single</em> class (remember, WPF uses the <code>partial</code> keyword to declare control classes), so there will only be a single box for each control.</p><p>Technically, any control you embed inside another control is a <em>composition</em> relationship, i.e. adding a <code>&lt;TextBox></code> to a custom control. However, in the interest of legibility of the resulting UML diagram, we will only show these relationships for custom controls defined in our project. So you will need to show the relationship between <code>MainWindow</code>, <code>MenuItemSelectionControl</code>, and <code>OrderSummaryControl</code> (as well as any other custom controls you create, if you also compose these controls with simpler user-defined controls).</p><p>Also, if you made any modifications to the data project, remember to update its UML diagram as well. This also includes fixing any issues your grader found in your previous diagram version.</p><p><strong>Note: You do not need to create a UML diagram of your <code>DataTest</code> project, though you can if you want.</strong></p><h2 id=submitting-the-assignment>Submitting the Assignment</h2><p>Once your project is complete, merge your feature branch back into the <code>main</code> branch and <a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-and-github/12-release/ rel=external target=_blank>create a release</a> tagged <code>v0.5.0</code> with name <code>"Milestone 5"</code>. Copy the URL for the release page and submit it to the Canvas assignment.</p><h2 id=grading-rubric>Grading Rubric</h2><p>The grading rubric for this assignment will be:</p><p><strong>20% Structure</strong> Did you implement the structure as laid out in the specification? Are the correct names used for classes, enums, properties, methods, events, etc? Do classes inherit from expected base classes?</p><p><strong>20% Documentation</strong> Does every class, method, property, and field use the correct XML-style documentation? Does every XML comment tag contain explanatory text?</p><p><strong>20% Design</strong> Are you appropriately using C# to create reasonably efficient, secure, and usable software? Does your code contain bugs that will cause issues at runtime?</p><p><strong>20% Functionality</strong> Does the program do what the assignment asks? Do properties return the expected values? Do methods perform the expected actions?</p><p><strong>20% UML Diagrams</strong> Does your UML diagram reflect the code actually in your release? Are all classes, enums, etc. included? Are associations correctly identified?</p><div class="box notices cstyle warning"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div><div class=box-content><p>Projects that do not compile will receive an automatic grade of 0.</p></div></div><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1724766097 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1724766097 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1724766097 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/embed-iframe.js?1724766097 defer></script></body></html>
