This is most easily accomplished by replacing the <code>Order</code> object bound to the <code>DataContext</code> of your top-level order control with a new <code>Order</code> instance. If your databinding is set up correctly, this will empty the displayed order, zero the displayed subtotal, tax, and total, and a new order number will be displayed.</p><h4 id=completing-the-order>Completing the Order</h4><p>The &ldquo;Complete Order&rdquo; button should also be available somewhere in the GUI at every step of taking the order. Clicking it should display the payment options screen.</p><h4 id=payment-options-screen>Payment Options Screen</h4><p>The three payment options should be prominently displayed using appropriate controls. These options are &ldquo;Cash&rdquo; and &ldquo;Credit/Debit&rdquo;. In addition, the order details should continue to be visible, in case the customer wants to confirm any details. There should also be a &ldquo;Return to Order&rdquo; button that returns to the active order to allow for additional changes to be made.</p><p>Choosing the &ldquo;Credit/Debit&rdquo; option should invoke the <code>CardReader.RunCard()</code> method defined in <em>RoundRegister.dll</em> with the amount of the transaction. This will return one of five options (also defined in <em>RoundRegister.dll</em>&rsquo;s <code>RoundRegister</code> namespace):</p><ul><li><code>CardTransactionResult.Approved</code></li><li><code>CardTransactionResult.Declined</code></li><li><code>CardTransactionResult.ReadError</code></li><li><code>CardTransactionResult.InsufficientFunds</code></li><li><code>CardTransactionResult.IncorrectPin</code></li></ul><p>If the result is <code>CardTransactionResult.Approved</code>, the order receipt should print. Then a new order should begin (see the details on <em>Canceling the Order</em> above for details).</p><p>Choosing the &ldquo;Cash&rdquo; option should display a special GUI for taking a cash payment from the customer, as detailed in the <em>Cash Payment Processing</em> below.</p><h4 id=cash-payment-processing>Cash Payment Processing</h4><p>The Round Register includes a cash drawer which initially contains a set amount of bills and coins. The static <code>CashDrawer</code> class in the <em>RoundRegister.dll</em> represents this drawer, and keeps track of each of the number of each kind of currency it contains. As customer payments are taken, and change given, the drawer&rsquo;s values need to be updated to reflect the changing amounts of currency.</p><p>Unfortunately, the developers of Round Payments, Inc. did not provide a class that will integrate with a WPF form easily. You will therefore need to create an intermediary class to update the <code>RoundRegister.CashDrawer</code> and serve as the <code>DataContext</code> for your cash payment control. This intermediary class will need to provide properties for the GUI to bind. These properties need to include:</p><ol><li>Properties to represent the quantity of each kind of currency <em>in the drawer</em></li><li>Properties to represent the quantity of each kind of currency <em>the customer is using to pay</em></li><li>Properties to represent the quantity of each kind of currency <em>that should be provided to the customer as change</em> for the transaction.</li></ol><p>This intermediate class also needs to incorporate the logic for making appropriate change. Hint: Always start with the largest currency possible, and make use of the modulus operator or <code>Math.Floor()</code>.</p><p>Finally, you need to provide a method for finalizing the transaction which invokes the <code>CashDrawer.Open()</code> method, adds the quantity of currency the customer paid to the <code>CashDrawer</code>&rsquo;s fields, and deducts the quantity given as change.</p><p>If you set up this intermediate control correctly, your codebehind for the cash payment control should be minimal - you will need to bind the intermediate class as the <code>DataContext</code>, and all your controls should be set up as bindings.</p><p>Thus, the <code>RoundRegister.CashDrawer</code> is the <em>Model</em>, your intermediary class is the <em>ModelView</em>, and the custom WPF user control is the <em>View</em> of the MVVM architectural pattern.</p><p>A possible configuration for the cash payment control might be:</p><p><a href=#R-image-9957c4521228341173be3a50234a41e0 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Cash Payment Control Mockup" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis400/images/CashPayment.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Once this has finished, you should print the receipt and begin a new order (see the details on <em>Canceling the Order</em> above for details).</p><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>You may optionally use a more common subset of currency denominations in your View and ViewModel consisting of: Pennies, Nickels, Dimes, Quarters, Ones, Fives, Tens, and Twenties.</p></div></div><h4 id=printing-the-receipt>Printing the Receipt</h4><p>The <em>RoundRegister.dll</em> contains a <code>ReceiptPrinter</code> class that exposes two methods:</p><ul><li><code>PrintLine(string text)</code> prints a single line of text onto the receipt tape.</li><li><code>CutTape()</code> cuts the register tape, so the printed receipt can be removed.</li></ul><p>You should add to your PointOfSale project a method or class that manages printing a receipt based on an order and payment method. The printed receipt must contain:</p><ul><li>The order number</li><li>The date and time the order was finalized</li><li>A complete list of all items in the order, including their price and any customization instructions</li><li>The subtotal for the order</li><li>The tax for the order</li><li>The total for the order</li><li>The payment method (i.e. cash or card)</li><li>The change owed</li></ul><p>The arrangement of these items and their labels should be such that a customer would reasonably be able to understand the entire receipt. You will need to print the receipt one line at a time with <code>PrintLine(string text)</code> and finish with a <code>CutTape()</code> call. Also, note that <strong>each line in the receipt cannot be longer than 40 characters</strong>. The <code>PrintLine()</code> method does not account for this hardware limitation - so <strong>you</strong> will need to ensure that no line exceeds this limit!</p><p>To make it easier for you to check your work, the printed results are saved in a file, <em>receipts.txt</em>, which should end up in your <em>debug</em> folder.</p><p>You should print a receipt for each completed sale.</p><h4 id=testing-the-cash-payment-processing>Testing the Cash Payment Processing</h4><p>One of the primary benefits of the MVVM architecture is it allows you to push logic that would otherwise be in the View classes into the ViewModel, and create unit tests for this ViewModel. You should write unit tests for the intermediate class that test the ability to make correct change, finalize the sale, and update properties correctly.</p><p>You may either add your tests to your existing test project and add the <code>PointOfSale</code> project as a dependency, or create a second test project to test classes defined in <code>PointOfSale</code>.</p><div class="box notices cstyle tip"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip</div><div class=box-content><p>Since you will not be able to replace the <code>CashDrawer</code> with a mock instance, you should invoke its <code>Reset()</code> method at the start of each test to ensure that each test starts with the drawer in the same state.</p></div></div><h4 id=testing-the-payment-gui>Testing the Payment GUI</h4><p>While you will be able to unit-test any ViewModel classes you have written programmatically, the GUI functionality must still be hand-tested. At this point, you will need to write a testing document. It should include a test process for:</p><ol><li>Adding items to an order</li><li>Customizing the items in the order as they are added</li><li>Customizing the items in the order if they are edited</li><li>Removing items in the order</li><li>Taking a Credit Card Payment</li><li>Taking a Cash Payment</li><li>Stopping taking a payment early to return to the order and adding additional items</li><li>Canceling the order and starting a new one</li></ol><p>For each of these test sequences, you should include <em>exact</em> details of what buttons or controls a user must interact with, and what the expected outcomes will be (hint: screenshots are your friend here). For example, if you ask the tester to click the &ldquo;Flying Saucer&rdquo; button, you should then have them look for the corresponding item in the Order Summary, and verify the price. Then, if you have them add a pancake, you should have them verify the price has updated.</p><h4 id=update-your-uml-diagrams>Update Your UML Diagrams</h4><p>You will need to update your UML diagrams to reflect the changes you have made to the <code>Data</code> and <code>PointOfSale</code> projects. Remember to mark the associations between your <code>Order</code> and its various <code>IMenuItem</code> instances.</p><h2 id=submitting-the-assignment>Submitting the Assignment</h2><p>Once your project is complete, merge your feature branch back into the <code>main</code> branch and <a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-and-github/12-release/ rel=external target=_blank>create a release</a> tagged <code>v0.8.0</code> with name <code>"Milestone 8"</code>.
