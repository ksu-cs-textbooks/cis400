These repositories will all share a common history (i.e. they are clones). We’ll give two of them special names: upstream and origin. In addition, you may have multiple local clones as well - typically one for each machine you develop on.</p><ul><li><strong>upstream</strong> is the repository I have created with the framework of our project in it.</li><li><strong>origin</strong> is your clone of the upstream repository that is hosted on GitHub, created through GitHub Classroom. Your local repositories will be cloned from this one.</li><li><strong>local</strong> you will have at least one local repository where you update your code to meet the assignments’ requirements. It is possible you may have multiple local repos - for example, one on the lab computer, and one on your desktop at home.</li></ul><h2 id=workflows>Workflows</h2><ul><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/03-clone/ rel=external target=_blank>Cloning your origin repository</a> to create a local repository.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/05-commit/ rel=external target=_blank>Committing changes</a> in a local repository.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/06-push/ rel=external target=_blank>Pushing changes</a> in a local repository to your origin repository.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/07-pull/ rel=external target=_blank>Pulling changes</a> from your origin repository to your local repository.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/08-merge-conflicts/ rel=external target=_blank>Resolving merge conflicts</a> after a merge or pull.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/09-release/ rel=external target=_blank>Creating a release</a></li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/10-ignoring-files/ rel=external target=_blank>Ignoring files</a> with a <em>.gitignore</em> file.</li><li><a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-workflows/11-adding-documentation-files/ rel=external target=_blank>Adding documentation files</a> to your repository.</li></ul><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1724347214 defer></script></body></html>
