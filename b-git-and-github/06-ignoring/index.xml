For example, compilers often create temporary or intermediate files during the compilation process, and these will be recreated every time we re-compile. We also usually donâ€™t want to commit the compiled binary files either, as we can always compile our code to get a fresh copy. Not saving these files means our repository takes up less memory, and Git operations are faster.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-and-github/06-ignoring/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
