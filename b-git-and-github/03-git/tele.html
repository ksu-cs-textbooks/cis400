Most people use the open-source command-line <code>git</code> client available from <a href=https://git-scm.com/downloads rel=external target=_blank>https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>, but there are other clients that provide GUI experiences and the like. Here we&rsquo;ll focus on the command-line version.</p><p>You can also learn more from the official <a href=https://git-scm.com/doc rel=external target=_blank>Git Documentation</a> or the free online <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 rel=external target=_blank>Pro Git Book</a>. These are great resources for expanding your Git knowledge, as this appendix is only going to hit the conceptual high points of Git and focus on the workflows you&rsquo;ll be using for this class.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis400/js/clipboard.min.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/theme.js?1724347214 defer></script><script src=/cis400/js/tele-scroll.js?1724347214 defer></script></body></html>
