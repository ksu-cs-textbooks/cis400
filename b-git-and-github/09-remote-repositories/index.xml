This means it has no central server. Instead, we can create copies of the repository we call remote repositories with the git clone command. These copies can be placed anywhere - in another directory on your computer, or on a different computer on your network, or a computer accessed via the internet.
GitHub is a web service that specifically hosts remote git repositories and allows you to access them through both your git client and through a web (HTML/CSS/JS) interface.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-and-github/09-remote-repositories/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
