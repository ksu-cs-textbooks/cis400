This extra step often confuses new Git users, but it exists to give you full control over what gets committed into your repository.
It may help to understand how Git thinks about files. Files in your repository directory fall into one of five categories - untracked, unstaged, staged, committed, and ignored.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/b-git-and-github/05-staging-and-committing/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
